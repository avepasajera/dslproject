320
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,190
Because I don't like being
told what to do.

321

I don't like being summoned.

322

But it felt even worse
not hearing from him for two years.

323

My mother gave it to me
when I was little.

325
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,552
She wanted it to teach me
that people have two sides.

326
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,676
A good side, a bad side.

327
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,070
A past, a future.

328
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:06,557
And that we must embrace both
in someone we love.

And I tried.

330
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,559
What's he like?

331
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:32,753
He's different from anybody I know.

332
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,912

930
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:16,830
Are you with me this time?

931
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:44,357
<font color="#808080">JONES:</font>
Come on. Let him up.

932
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:47,192
I'm just a tourist.

933
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:51,869
I'm just a tourist.

934
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:55,715
He said I might get
arrested at some point.

935
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:58,553
- What?
- But that you'd have to let me go

936
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:00,597
because you'd have nothing on me.

937
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:03,558
- Who?
- The man that's sending me texts.

938
01:34:04,360 --> 01:34:08,273
- Texts?
- And the money, of course.

939
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:16,870
So let me get this straight
because I'm a little confused.

940
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:20,831
You receive money
from a man you've never met before

941
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:25,437
who sends you text messages
telling you just to show up somewhere.

942
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:27,394
Well...

943
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:32,399
not just anywhere.

"Seven hundred and forty-four million."

948
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:20,272
Inspector Acheson,

949
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:23,074
this operation
is now officially terminated.

950
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:25,994
- I'll expect your report on Monday.
- Sir, listen.

951
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:29,152
- We have our money, Acheson.
- But we don't have Pearce.

952
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:33,158
The man's a criminal
wanted in 14 countries.

953
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:36,439
Well, what is it he did, really?

954
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:39,674
He stole money from a gangster.

955
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:41,353
A dead gangster.

956
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:43,954
And he has good taste in women.

957
01:35:44,680 --> 01:35:46,989
I can't say I don't wish him well.

958
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:20,910
<font color="#D900D9">(♪♪♪)</font>

959
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:30,876
Twenty million dollars'
worth of plastic surgery.

960
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:33,031
And that's the face you choose?

961
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:34,715
Do you not like it?

962
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:37,678
It'll do.
