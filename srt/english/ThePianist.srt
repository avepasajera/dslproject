1
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,894
- Mr. Szpilman?
- Hello.

2
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,647
I came specially to meet you.
I love your playing.

3
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,693
- Who are you?
- My name's Dorota, Jurek's sister.

4
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,445
- You're bleeding!
- It's nothing.

5
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:37,533
You can write him a fan letter later.
This isn't the best time. Come on.

6
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,993
Jurek, where have you been hiding her?

7
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:47,000
- I don't know what to take.
- You always take too much.

8
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:49,942
How many suitcases are you taking?

9
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:50,963
I'm packing my red dress.

10
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,653
And what, what do you think, should I,

11
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,483
should I take uncle Szymon's portrait?

12
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,383
Take it, don't take it,
take what you like.

13
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:02,558
- Can't you see I'm worried sick?
- Oh... He'll come home, he'll be alright.

14
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,081
We should have
another case just for shoes.

15
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:06,979
Wladek, oh! Mama, Wladek's home!

16
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:11,274
Oh! Thank God. Wladek! You're wounded?

17
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,131
No, no, no,
it's a little cut, it's nothing.

18
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,820
Oh, I've been worried sick.

19
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,406
I told her not to worry.
You had your papers on you.

20
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:19,638
If you'd been hit by a bomb,
they'd have known where to take you.

21
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:20,858
Henryk, Henryk,

22
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,016
don't say things like...
don't say things like that.

23
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,935
- I can't find anything.
- God forbid. God forbid.

24
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,895
- Papa, Wladek's home.
- What did I tell you?

25
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:27,875
- What are you doing?
- What's it look like we're doing?

26
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Has anybody seen
my hat with the wide brim?

27
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,193
I don't know they bombed us,
we're off the air.

28
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,928
Warsaw's not the only radio station.

29
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:37,676
Ah? Pack, pack, darling.
Get your things, pack.

30
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:40,220
- Where are we going?
- Pfff. Out of Warsaw.

31
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:42,346
- Out of Warsaw where?
- You haven't heard?

32
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,538
- Heard what?
- Haven't you seen the paper?

33
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,270
- Oh, where's the paper?
- I used it for packing.

34
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,563
Oh, she used it for packing.

35
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:50,689
The government's moved to Lublin.

36
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,796
All able bodied men must leave the city,

37
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:55,799
go across the river and set up a new line
of defense, that's what it said.

38
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:59,345
There's hardly anybody left in this
building only the women the men have gone.

39
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:02,306
And what do you think you'll do while
you're setting up a new line of defense?

40
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:06,164
- Wonder around lugging your suitcases?
- Pack, Wladek. There's no time.

41
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:10,168
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Good! I'm not going anywhere either!

42
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:12,628
Don't be ridiculous,
we've got to keep together.

43
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:13,754
No, no, look, look.

44
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:16,695
If I'm going to die, I prefer to die
in my own home, staying put.

45
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:19,593
- God forbid.
- Sssh! Shut up! I've got something listen.

46
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:22,721
...from the BBC in London.

47
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:30,104
The British government... having received
no reply to the ultimatum presented...

48
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:31,855
to the German government...

49
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:35,276
has declared war on Nazi Germany.

50
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:39,197
- Oh, oh, that's wonderful! Wonderful!
- It is expected that...

51
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,870
...within the next few hours,

52
00:04:46,996 --> 00:04:49,915
France will make a similar declaration.

53
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,626
Poland is no longer alone.

54
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:53,951
- My God!
- Oh! Oh!

55
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:01,052
It's great, great, wonderful, wonderful!

56
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:06,474
- Mama, that was a great dinner.
- Hm! Yes, it certainly was.

57
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:09,582
Well when there's something to celebrate,
you've got to make an effort.

58
00:05:09,602 --> 00:05:11,896
Here's to Great Britain and France!

59
00:05:13,106 --> 00:05:16,442
I told you. Didn't I tell you?
All will be well.

60
00:05:16,609 --> 00:05:18,361
- Hey!
- Oh!

61
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:51,509
Five thousand and three.

62
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:54,762
Is that all?

63
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:57,631
Yes, five thousand and three zlotys,
that's all we've got left.

64
00:05:57,651 --> 00:06:00,236
It's three thousand and three
zlotys too much. Look...

65
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:04,282
"Re: Further restrictions
regarding liquid assets.

66
00:06:04,616 --> 00:06:08,283
Jews will be allowed to keep a maximum
of two thousand zlotys in their homes."

67
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:12,624
- What do we do with the rest?
- Deposit it in a bank. A blocked account.

68
00:06:12,707 --> 00:06:16,544
Banks?! Who'd be stupid enough
to deposit money in a German bank?

69
00:06:16,711 --> 00:06:21,675
We could hide the money. Look here. We can
hide the money under the flower pot.

70
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,866
No, no, no. I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll use try and tested methods.

71
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:26,648
You know what we did in the last war?

72
00:06:27,556 --> 00:06:29,891
We made a hole in the table leg...

73
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:31,445
and we hid the money in there.

74
00:06:31,518 --> 00:06:34,208
- And suppose they take the table away?
- What do you mean take the table away?

75
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:36,753
The Germans go into Jewish homes
and they just take what they want...

76
00:06:36,773 --> 00:06:38,942
furniture, valuables, anything.

77
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:40,924
- Do they?
- Idiot! What would they want with a table.

78
00:06:40,944 --> 00:06:42,144
Hey? A table like this?

79
00:06:43,196 --> 00:06:45,740
- What on earth are you doing?
- No, listen, look.

80
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:47,909
This is the best place for it.

81
00:06:48,034 --> 00:06:50,368
No-one would think of looking
under the flowerpot.

82
00:06:50,537 --> 00:06:52,519
No, no. No, no.
Listen, listen, I've been thinking...

83
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:53,873
Oh! Really? That's a change.

84
00:06:53,957 --> 00:06:56,751
- You know what we do? We use psychology.
- We use what?

85
00:06:57,335 --> 00:06:59,574
We leave the money
and the watch on the table...

86
00:06:59,838 --> 00:07:02,090
and we cover it like this. In full view.

87
00:07:04,676 --> 00:07:05,594
Are you stupid?

88
00:07:05,719 --> 00:07:08,242
The Germans will search high and low,
I promise you, they'll never notice.

89
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:11,882
That's the stupidest thing I've ever seen.
Of course they'll notice it. Look.

90
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:16,062
Look here... Idiot.

91
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:17,981
And you call me stupid.

92
00:07:18,106 --> 00:07:20,129
No, that is very good
because that is the last place...

93
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:22,674
- This would take hours.
- We are not in a hurry. We'd get it back.

94
00:07:22,694 --> 00:07:24,676
- It won't take hours.
- How will you get them out? Tell me that!

95
00:07:24,696 --> 00:07:26,595
Tell me that, I would like to know.
How would you get them out?

96
00:07:26,615 --> 00:07:28,388
- Why do you resist?
- Quiet! Order, please!

97
00:07:28,408 --> 00:07:30,307
- You take each one out individually.
- Order please!

98
00:07:30,327 --> 00:07:31,933
No-one listens to me, no one listens.

99
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:34,956
Quiet, please, quiet!
Order, order, please!

100
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,877
- She's a lawyer, she likes order.
- Listen, just listen. Look,

101
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,484
the watch we put under the flowerpots
and the money we stuff in the violin.

102
00:07:43,882 --> 00:07:45,082
Um...

103
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:49,179
- Will I still be able to play?
- Well, you'll find out.

104
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:53,767
- Jurek? It's Wladek Szpilman.
- Wladek, how are you?

105
00:07:54,518 --> 00:07:56,811
Fine, fine, we're fine, thank you.
And you?

106
00:07:57,187 --> 00:08:01,483
Fine, we're fine under the circumstances.
But I guess what you've called about.

107
00:08:01,608 --> 00:08:04,091
There's nothing we can do.
They won't re-open the station.

108
00:08:04,111 --> 00:08:05,588
Just won't re-open the station.

109
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,614
Yes, I know, but um, Jurek...

110
00:08:07,739 --> 00:08:10,117
Not even music, nothing,
no radios for the Poles.

111
00:08:10,242 --> 00:08:11,076
I know, Jurek!

112
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,413
But I'm sure you'll find work.
A pianist like you Wladek!

113
00:08:14,496 --> 00:08:16,915
Well, maybe, maybe not, but um...

114
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:21,711
listen, don't be offended, but I didn't
call to discuss my future career.

115
00:08:22,462 --> 00:08:25,748
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks,
and at last he gave in and said...

116
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:29,178
"All right, come with me tomorrow",
And so I came and...

117
00:08:29,303 --> 00:08:31,221
they bombed the station.

118
00:08:32,056 --> 00:08:34,663
I tell you, meeting you like that
was absolutely wonderful.

119
00:08:34,683 --> 00:08:38,687
- Really?
- Yes, it was... It was unforgettable.

120
00:08:39,813 --> 00:08:41,836
I've always loved your playing,
Mr. Szpilman.

121
00:08:41,856 --> 00:08:42,857
Call me Wladek, please.

122
00:08:42,983 --> 00:08:45,945
- No-one plays Chopin like you.
- I hope that's a compliment.

123
00:08:46,403 --> 00:08:50,115
- Of course, I mean it.
- I was... trying to be funny.

124
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,890
Shall we go to the Paradiso,
have a coffee?

125
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,244
I'd like that.

126
00:08:56,038 --> 00:09:00,000
- And you, what do you do?
- I finished with the conservatoire.

127
00:09:00,084 --> 00:09:03,003
- You're a musician?
- Yes. But only just.

128
00:09:03,253 --> 00:09:04,880
- What instrument?
- The cello.

129
00:09:06,006 --> 00:09:07,925
I love to see a women playing the cello.

130
00:09:09,468 --> 00:09:10,668
Here we are.

131
00:09:11,553 --> 00:09:12,930
NO JEWS

132
00:09:13,055 --> 00:09:16,100
This is disgraceful. How dare they?

133
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:19,458
You know what people are like,
they want to be better Nazis than Hitler.

134
00:09:19,478 --> 00:09:23,190
- I'm going in there to complain.
- No. It's better not, believe me.

135
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:27,027
- It's so humiliating. Someone like you!
- Good-bye!

136
00:09:31,698 --> 00:09:32,950
We'll find somewhere else.

137
00:09:34,034 --> 00:09:36,871
- We can walk in the park.
- No, we can't.

138
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:41,166
It's an official decree.
No Jews allowed in the park.

139
00:09:41,751 --> 00:09:44,336
- My God. Are you joking?
- I'm not joking, it's true.

140
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,820
I suggest we just sit on a bench somewhere
but that's another official decree,

141
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,555
"no Jews allowed on public benches".

142
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:51,176
This is absurd!

143
00:09:51,635 --> 00:09:54,680
I'll tell you what we can do.
We can just stand here and talk.

144
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,266
I think we're allowed to do that,
don't you?

145
00:09:58,558 --> 00:10:00,978
So, you play the cello Dorota.
That's nice.

146
00:10:01,604 --> 00:10:05,482
And who's your favorite composer?
Chopin? Really? Well...

147
00:10:05,941 --> 00:10:08,608
you'll have to learn to play
his cello sonata, won't you?

148
00:10:08,861 --> 00:10:11,530
And what about you, Wladek? Well...

149
00:10:11,781 --> 00:10:14,829
Perhaps I could accompany you.
Me on the piano, you on the cello.

150
00:10:15,034 --> 00:10:18,287
Oh, Mr. Szpilman, you're quite,
quite wonderful.

151
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,083
Call me Wladek, please.

152
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,671
"Re: emblems for Jews
in the Warsaw district.

153
00:10:27,212 --> 00:10:30,215
I hereby order that all Jews
in the Warsaw district...

154
00:10:30,424 --> 00:10:33,427
will wear visible emblems
when out of doors.

155
00:10:33,969 --> 00:10:38,683
This decree will come into force
on the 1st of December, 1939...

156
00:10:38,849 --> 00:10:41,852
and applies to all Jews
over 12 years of age.

157
00:10:42,645 --> 00:10:45,523
The emblem will be worn
on the right sleeve...

158
00:10:46,106 --> 00:10:49,860
and will represent a blue star
of David on a white background.

159
00:10:50,528 --> 00:10:53,573
The background must
be sufficiently large...

160
00:10:53,698 --> 00:10:57,452
for the star to measure eight
centimeters from point to point.

161
00:10:58,077 --> 00:11:01,747
The width of the arms of the star
must be one centimeter.

162
00:11:02,373 --> 00:11:07,545
The Jews that do not respect this
decree will be severely punished.

163
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,758
Governor of Warsaw district,
Dr. Fischer."

164
00:11:15,845 --> 00:11:16,846
I won't wear it.

165
00:11:16,971 --> 00:11:19,557
I won't wear it.
I'm not going to be branded.

166
00:11:23,978 --> 00:11:25,438
Let, let me see this.

167
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:33,821
Does it say that we have to provide
these armbands ourselves?

168
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,597
- Where will we get them?
- We're not going to get them.

169
00:11:37,617 --> 00:11:39,702
We're not going to wear them!

170
00:11:48,378 --> 00:11:49,578
You!

171
00:11:51,381 --> 00:11:52,673
Come here.

172
00:11:59,597 --> 00:12:01,432
Why didn't you bow?

173
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,310
I beg your pardon.

174
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,323
You're forbidden to walk on the pavement.

175
00:12:18,533 --> 00:12:20,035
Walk in the gutter!

176
00:12:37,093 --> 00:12:41,056
- Have you seen this?
- What, what, what? I'm working. What?

177
00:12:42,807 --> 00:12:44,142
What is it?

178
00:12:45,685 --> 00:12:48,828
- That's where they're going to put us.
- What do you mean, put us?

179
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:55,403
"By order of the governor of the
Warsaw district, Dr. Fischer...

180
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:58,990
concerning the establishment of
the Jewish district in Warsaw.

181
00:12:59,282 --> 00:13:02,869
There will be created a Jewish district
in which all Jews living in Warsaw

182
00:13:02,994 --> 00:13:05,121
or moving to Warsaw will have to reside."

183
00:13:05,956 --> 00:13:09,750
Look here. "Jews living outside
of the prescribed area

184
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:15,131
will have to move to the Jewish
district by 31st of October, 1940."

185
00:13:16,549 --> 00:13:21,054
They won't get all of us. It's too small.
There's 400 thousand of us in Warsaw.

186
00:13:21,137 --> 00:13:24,015
No, 360 thousand. So it will be easy.

187
00:13:24,808 --> 00:13:28,311
What am I supposed to do? Hm? You tell me.

188
00:13:28,394 --> 00:13:30,823
You're a clever man,
you'll tell me what I will buy.

189
00:13:30,856 --> 00:13:32,056
I do my best.

190
00:13:32,315 --> 00:13:33,515
Mama?

191
00:13:34,985 --> 00:13:37,612
Mama, what is it?

192
00:13:37,904 --> 00:13:40,490
20 zlotys!

193
00:13:42,367 --> 00:13:45,286
That's all we have left, 20 zlotys.

194
00:13:48,164 --> 00:13:51,752
What, what can I buy with 20 zlotys?

195
00:13:53,253 --> 00:13:57,048
I am sick of cooking potatoes,
potatoes, potatoes.

196
00:14:05,348 --> 00:14:07,643
That's the price.
That's what I'm offering.

197
00:14:07,768 --> 00:14:10,578
My advice is to accept.
You won't get more from anyone else.

198
00:14:10,729 --> 00:14:14,650
- But, it's a Bechstein, Mr. Lipa!
- Two thousand. My advice is to take it.

199
00:14:15,108 --> 00:14:17,870
What are you going to do when
you're hungry? Eat the piano?

200
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:21,114
- Get out!
- Hey! What's the matter with you?

201
00:14:21,197 --> 00:14:23,304
- Stop it!
- We'd rather give it away. Go on, get out!

202
00:14:23,324 --> 00:14:25,801
Haven't you eaten today? Hm?
What you suffering from?

203
00:14:27,245 --> 00:14:28,580
You people are crazy.

204
00:14:30,081 --> 00:14:33,669
I'm doing you a favor. Two thousand
and I'm paying for the removal.

205
00:14:33,877 --> 00:14:35,687
I'm not even charging for the removal!

206
00:14:37,548 --> 00:14:39,716
You haven't eaten today. You're crazy.

207
00:14:40,091 --> 00:14:41,291
Take it.

208
00:15:16,462 --> 00:15:17,662
Hello.

209
00:15:19,548 --> 00:15:20,799
Hello. Hi.

210
00:15:23,719 --> 00:15:25,387
I didn't want to come.

211
00:15:26,222 --> 00:15:30,726
I didn't want to see all this, but...
I couldn't stop myself.

212
00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:33,187
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

213
00:15:33,312 --> 00:15:34,512
Good.

214
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:38,359
No, not really. They arrested my cousin.

215
00:15:39,318 --> 00:15:41,237
Jurek says they'll let him out.

216
00:15:42,988 --> 00:15:47,117
- This is disgraceful.
- It won't last long. Don't worry.

217
00:15:47,701 --> 00:15:49,786
That's what I said myself.

218
00:15:51,247 --> 00:15:52,706
It's too absurd.

219
00:15:57,711 --> 00:16:00,297
I ah... I should go.

220
00:16:02,758 --> 00:16:05,219
Well, I'll, I'll see you...

221
00:16:06,178 --> 00:16:07,378
soon.

222
00:16:11,975 --> 00:16:13,175
Good-bye.

223
00:16:28,534 --> 00:16:29,952
Well...

224
00:16:30,702 --> 00:16:34,498
to tell you the truth,
I thought it would be worse.

225
00:16:41,047 --> 00:16:44,967
- Where will we sleep?
- I sleep in the kitchen with the girls.

226
00:16:45,634 --> 00:16:48,137
You, Henryk and papa, in here.

227
00:16:50,222 --> 00:16:51,432
Look.

228
00:16:53,392 --> 00:16:54,768
Come and look.

229
00:17:28,219 --> 00:17:31,597
Go away. Go away! Go away!

230
00:17:33,639 --> 00:17:37,186
Papa! Papa! Papa!

231
00:17:52,533 --> 00:17:56,122
- Sell anything?
- Just one. Dostoievski, The Idiot.

232
00:17:56,287 --> 00:17:58,958
- Three zlotys.
- It's better than yesterday.

233
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:03,462
Three lousy zlotys. And there are
people there making millions.

234
00:18:03,545 --> 00:18:06,007
- I know.
- You don't know, believe me.

235
00:18:06,673 --> 00:18:09,636
They bribe the guards,
the guards turn a blind eye.

236
00:18:10,094 --> 00:18:14,891
They're bringing in cartloads of food,
tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics.

237
00:18:15,141 --> 00:18:17,248
And the poor are dying all around
and they don't give a damn.

238
00:18:17,268 --> 00:18:20,855
Excuse me, have you seen
my husband, Izaak Szerman?

239
00:18:21,648 --> 00:18:25,276
A tall, a tall handsome man,
with a little gray beard... No?

240
00:18:25,527 --> 00:18:30,071
- I'm afraid not.
- Excuse me. Good-bye.

241
00:18:30,281 --> 00:18:33,993
Sleep well. But, but, but if you see him,
write to me, yes?

242
00:18:34,826 --> 00:18:36,162
Izaak Szerman.

243
00:18:51,135 --> 00:18:54,471
Why do we have to have a gentile
street running through our area?

244
00:18:54,596 --> 00:18:56,433
Why can't they go around?

245
00:18:56,933 --> 00:19:00,645
Don't worry about it. They're about
to build a bridge. Haven't you heard?

246
00:19:01,563 --> 00:19:03,565
A bridge, a bridge a smedge.

247
00:19:04,856 --> 00:19:07,359
The Germans claim to be intelligent.

248
00:19:07,527 --> 00:19:10,822
But do you know what I think?
I think they are totally stupid.

249
00:19:11,406 --> 00:19:14,826
I have a family to feed.
I spend half of my time here

250
00:19:14,951 --> 00:19:16,786
waiting for them to let us through.

251
00:19:17,579 --> 00:19:20,164
Maybe they think I come
here to listen to the music?

252
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,377
You're cold?

253
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,841
Dance!

254
00:19:30,342 --> 00:19:32,469
- Dance!
- Dance!

255
00:19:32,594 --> 00:19:36,137
Come on, come on! Dance!

256
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,292
Faster!

257
00:20:49,754 --> 00:20:50,954
Good, they're here.

258
00:20:53,215 --> 00:20:55,302
Yitzchak Heller's been waiting for you.

259
00:21:02,474 --> 00:21:04,124
- What's this about?
- Sit down, have tea.

260
00:21:04,144 --> 00:21:06,646
I'll start lunch when the girls get here.

261
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,863
- So, what are you doing here?
- He brought cakes.

262
00:21:15,948 --> 00:21:19,616
His ah... his father's back
in the jewelery business.

263
00:21:19,742 --> 00:21:21,744
He's, uh, doing well, hey, Yitzchak, hey?

264
00:21:24,456 --> 00:21:26,083
Amazing, jewelery.

265
00:21:27,209 --> 00:21:29,251
- We're recruiting.
- Who is recruiting?

266
00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:32,039
Don't be clever with me, Henryk.
I'm coming as a friend.

267
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:34,446
They're bringing Jews
in from all over the country.

268
00:21:34,466 --> 00:21:36,657
Soon there will be half million
people in the ghetto.

269
00:21:36,677 --> 00:21:40,472
- We need more Jewish police.
- Oh! More Jewish police!

270
00:21:40,681 --> 00:21:44,582
You mean you want me to beat up Jews with
my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit.

271
00:21:44,602 --> 00:21:46,373
- I see!
- Someone's got to do it, Henryk.

272
00:21:46,393 --> 00:21:47,229
But why me?

273
00:21:47,354 --> 00:21:49,783
I thought you only recruited
boys with rich fathers.

274
00:21:50,022 --> 00:21:52,274
Look at my father, look at us, I mean.

275
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:53,966
Yes, I'm looking at you,
that's why I'm here.

276
00:21:53,986 --> 00:21:55,382
Your whole family can have a better life.

277
00:21:55,402 --> 00:21:57,845
You want to go on struggling for survival,
selling books on the street?

278
00:21:57,865 --> 00:21:59,074
Yes, please.

279
00:21:59,241 --> 00:22:01,827
I'm doing you people a favor.

280
00:22:03,035 --> 00:22:05,226
What about you, Wladek?
You're a great pianist.

281
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:07,062
And we've got an excellent
police jazz band.

282
00:22:07,082 --> 00:22:08,731
They'd welcome you with open arms.
Join us!

283
00:22:08,751 --> 00:22:11,043
- You've got no work.
- Thank you, I've got work.

284
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,676
Yes of course!

285
00:23:00,886 --> 00:23:02,845
I'm sorry, Wladek, he wants you to stop.

286
00:23:05,308 --> 00:23:06,724
Who wants me to stop?

287
00:23:59,112 --> 00:24:00,922
I always say, look on the bright side.

288
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:04,287
You're in a small ghetto with
intellectuals, professional people.

289
00:24:04,492 --> 00:24:08,204
You're better off than us.
Here in the large ghetto it's a cesspool.

290
00:24:08,329 --> 00:24:09,852
Jehuda, give me something to do.

291
00:24:09,872 --> 00:24:13,834
You're an artist, Wladek. You keep
peoples' spirits up. You do enough.

292
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,437
- I want to help, I want to do something.
- You're too well known, Wladek.

293
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:22,718
And you know what? You musicians
don't make good conspirators.

294
00:24:22,926 --> 00:24:27,015
You're too... too... musical.

295
00:24:32,853 --> 00:24:34,053
- Who is that?
- Symche.

296
00:24:34,147 --> 00:24:35,347
Majorek.

297
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:40,693
There are notices going up.
City is to be cleansed of undesirables.

298
00:24:40,818 --> 00:24:43,821
- No notices going up.
- Hello, Symche.

299
00:24:44,822 --> 00:24:47,700
Dolek... Mrs. Zyskind.

300
00:24:49,871 --> 00:24:51,789
Jehuda, working hard?

301
00:24:51,998 --> 00:24:56,084
Majorek. This is the greatest pianist
in Poland. Maybe the whole world.

302
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:58,629
Wladyslaw Szpilman, meet Majorek.

303
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,257
- How do you do?
- I know your name.

304
00:25:02,425 --> 00:25:05,330
- I've never heard you play.
- Majorek used to be in the Army.

305
00:25:05,718 --> 00:25:09,307
Brilliant man. The only thing I've got
against him is he's not a socialist.

306
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:14,145
You better go now, Wladek.
It's nearly curfew.

307
00:25:15,979 --> 00:25:18,360
You know how many copies
we print of our newspaper?

308
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:20,568
Five hundred.

309
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:24,781
You know how many people on
average read one copy? Twenty.

310
00:25:24,863 --> 00:25:29,327
That makes ten thousand readers.
These will start the uprising.

311
00:25:29,535 --> 00:25:32,746
Majorek hides them in his underpants
and leaves them in toilets.

312
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:35,416
- Toilets, huh?
- As many toilets as I can find.

313
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:38,044
Germans never use Jewish toilets.

314
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,504
They're too clean for them.

315
00:25:47,135 --> 00:25:49,888
Please, Mister, please, one zloty.

316
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:20,086
Hold it!
You little bastard!

317
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,886
Stop it! Stop it!

318
00:26:29,012 --> 00:26:30,212
Stop it!

319
00:26:33,349 --> 00:26:36,478
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on boy.

320
00:26:42,526 --> 00:26:45,153
Stand up. Stand up. Stand up!

321
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:21,104
Please, tonight for once, I don't
want anything bad talked about.

322
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:24,483
- Enjoy our meal.
- Fine, then I'll tell you something funny.

323
00:27:24,901 --> 00:27:26,550
You all know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja?

324
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:27,946
- The surgeon.
- The surgeon.

325
00:27:28,322 --> 00:27:30,239
Well, for some reason, don't ask me why,

326
00:27:30,699 --> 00:27:33,347
the Germans allowed him into
the ghetto to perform an operation.

327
00:27:33,367 --> 00:27:36,620
On a Jew? They let a Pole
to come in to operate on a Jew?

328
00:27:36,745 --> 00:27:39,873
He got a pass, that's all I know.
Anyway, so he...

329
00:27:40,084 --> 00:27:42,608
he puts the patient to sleep
and starts the operation.

330
00:27:42,711 --> 00:27:45,378
He'd just made the first incision
when the SS burst in...

331
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:47,404
shoot the patient lying on the table,

332
00:27:47,424 --> 00:27:50,008
then Dr. Raszeja and everybody
else who was there.

333
00:27:52,136 --> 00:27:53,336
Isn't that a laugh?

334
00:27:55,724 --> 00:27:58,767
The patient didn't feel a thing,
he was anesthetized.

335
00:27:59,061 --> 00:28:00,894
I said nothing bad, Henryk.

336
00:28:01,563 --> 00:28:05,484
What's the matter with you all, huh?
Huh? You lost your sense of humor?

337
00:28:06,443 --> 00:28:07,643
It's not funny.

338
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:11,949
Well, you know what's funny?
You're funny, with that ridiculous tie.

339
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,475
What are you talking about my tie for?
What's my tie have to do with anything?

340
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:18,830
- I need this tie for my work.
- Your work?

341
00:28:18,913 --> 00:28:21,105
- Yes, that's right, I work.
- Yes, yes, your work.

342
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:23,315
Playing the piano for all
the parasites in the ghetto.

343
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:24,628
- Parasites?
- Parasites.

344
00:28:24,711 --> 00:28:25,963
Boys. Boys!

345
00:28:26,088 --> 00:28:27,569
They don't give a damn
about people's sufferings.

346
00:28:27,589 --> 00:28:29,238
And you blame me for their apathy, right?

347
00:28:29,258 --> 00:28:31,093
I do because I see it every day.

348
00:28:31,175 --> 00:28:33,117
They don't even notice
what's going around them.

349
00:28:33,137 --> 00:28:35,376
- I blame the Americans.
- For what? For my tie?

350
00:28:35,722 --> 00:28:38,017
The American Jews,
and there are lots of them.

351
00:28:39,518 --> 00:28:41,415
What have they done for us, hey?
What do they think they're doing?

352
00:28:41,435 --> 00:28:44,313
People here are dying.
Haven't got a bite to eat.

353
00:28:45,858 --> 00:28:48,047
The Jewish bankers over there
should be persuading America

354
00:28:48,067 --> 00:28:49,568
to declare war on Germany.

355
00:29:07,546 --> 00:29:08,881
Lights! Lights!

356
00:30:02,518 --> 00:30:03,718
Stand up!

357
00:30:06,731 --> 00:30:09,399
You, stand up! Come on!

358
00:30:10,943 --> 00:30:12,361
Throw him out!

359
00:30:23,998 --> 00:30:25,666
Ah!

360
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:28,919
Shhh. Shhh. Be quiet, Mama,
for God's sake, shhh, be quiet.

361
00:30:29,044 --> 00:30:30,244
My God!

362
00:31:44,537 --> 00:31:46,539
Matches! Matches!

363
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:52,212
- Excuse me!
- Yes!

364
00:31:52,337 --> 00:31:55,715
- I'm Mr. Szpilman's sister.
- Yes, come in. Not you!

365
00:32:15,735 --> 00:32:18,071
- What's happened?
- Oh my God, it's terrible.

366
00:32:18,196 --> 00:32:20,656
- What?
- They're hunting people in the streets.

367
00:32:21,199 --> 00:32:22,658
They've taken Henryk.

368
00:32:25,203 --> 00:32:28,039
All right, go home, alright?
Go home, I'll take care of it.

369
00:32:39,885 --> 00:32:43,554
Excuse me. Have you seen
my husband? Izaak Szerman?

370
00:32:43,763 --> 00:32:47,642
- No, I'm afraid not.
- Tall, handsome, a little gray beard.

371
00:32:47,851 --> 00:32:51,729
If you see him, write to me.
Don't forget. Izaak Szerman.

372
00:32:53,189 --> 00:32:55,150
Faster, keep moving! Run!

373
00:33:01,489 --> 00:33:02,699
What happened here?

374
00:33:03,283 --> 00:33:07,328
They've got my grandson in there.
They pick them up, they take them away.

375
00:33:07,453 --> 00:33:11,166
What they do to them,
I've stopped believing in God.

376
00:33:12,042 --> 00:33:14,502
Excuse me. Excuse me.

377
00:33:15,921 --> 00:33:17,121
Yitzchak?

378
00:33:18,715 --> 00:33:23,053
Yitzchak? Yitzchak, here,
it's Wladek Szpilman!

379
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,840
Here!

380
00:33:30,018 --> 00:33:32,562
- Henryk's in there.
- I haven't seen him.

381
00:33:32,771 --> 00:33:35,023
- Believe me. They picked him up.
- Tough luck!

382
00:33:39,194 --> 00:33:40,111
Can you help?

383
00:33:40,195 --> 00:33:43,364
Oh, now you need me, yes, now you need me!

384
00:33:43,448 --> 00:33:44,648
Can you help us?

385
00:33:46,326 --> 00:33:49,120
- It costs.
- I have no money.

386
00:33:49,204 --> 00:33:49,996
Then there's nothing I can do.

387
00:33:50,121 --> 00:33:52,020
You should've joined us
when you had the chance.

388
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:56,377
- Yitzchak they told me you had influence.
- Who told you?

389
00:33:57,588 --> 00:34:00,298
People, people I know.
They said you're an important man.

390
00:34:02,843 --> 00:34:04,043
Yitzchak!

391
00:34:21,152 --> 00:34:24,114
- Who is this?
- Good morning Herr Rubinstein.

392
00:34:24,322 --> 00:34:28,034
Good morning.

393
00:34:28,243 --> 00:34:30,412
Kaputt. Kaputt.

394
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,503
- Want a cigarette?
- Cigarette? Mmm.

395
00:34:37,628 --> 00:34:39,254
Thank you.

396
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:08,742
Help! Help! Help! Help! A snatcher!
A snatcher! Help, help me!

397
00:36:01,587 --> 00:36:04,798
- Why did they pick you up?
- So you go to Yitzchak Heller?

398
00:36:05,216 --> 00:36:08,802
- Did I ask you to talk to him?
- You're out, aren't you?

399
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:11,911
Did you beg, did you grovel to
that piece of shit, that cockroach?

400
00:36:11,931 --> 00:36:13,884
I didn't grovel, I asked him to help you.

401
00:36:14,558 --> 00:36:15,809
What did you pay him?

402
00:36:17,769 --> 00:36:20,147
With what, with what could I pay him?
With what?

403
00:36:20,272 --> 00:36:22,441
Every zloty I earn we spend on food.

404
00:36:22,524 --> 00:36:25,652
- I can look after myself.
- They were taking you away.

405
00:36:25,777 --> 00:36:29,573
It's got nothing to do with you.
It's me they wanted, not you.

406
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:32,743
Why do you have to interfere
with other people's business?

407
00:36:33,327 --> 00:36:35,309
You're mad. That's,
that's your trouble, is your mad.

408
00:36:35,329 --> 00:36:37,164
That's also my business.

409
00:36:44,338 --> 00:36:49,385
Hey, hey! What's the matter?
What's the matter? Are you sick?

410
00:36:51,012 --> 00:36:52,471
Hungry.

411
00:36:56,893 --> 00:36:58,770
Mr. Szpilman!

412
00:37:00,688 --> 00:37:04,942
Employment certificate? What's that
mean, no employment certificate?

413
00:37:05,192 --> 00:37:08,029
You have to have an
employment certificate...

414
00:37:08,237 --> 00:37:11,178
to work for one of the German firms
in the ghetto, otherwise...

415
00:37:11,198 --> 00:37:13,993
- Otherwise what?
- You'll be deported.

416
00:37:14,076 --> 00:37:17,329
- So the rumors were true.
- They're going to resettle us...

417
00:37:18,455 --> 00:37:21,125
and send us to labor camps, in the East.

418
00:37:23,502 --> 00:37:25,963
- And they're closing the small ghetto.
- My God!

419
00:37:41,896 --> 00:37:43,940
Wladek? Wladek?

420
00:37:44,816 --> 00:37:48,736
I thought you'd be off on tour playing
London, Paris, New York, Chicago.

421
00:37:48,903 --> 00:37:50,822
- Not this week.
- You look terrible.

422
00:37:52,073 --> 00:37:54,972
Have you heard the rumors?
They're going to resettle us in the East.

423
00:37:54,992 --> 00:37:59,038
Rumors! You take it all too much
to heart Wladek. What's the trouble?

424
00:37:59,456 --> 00:38:03,084
I, I've been trying to get the
certificate of employment for my father.

425
00:38:03,835 --> 00:38:06,108
But I managed to get one for me
and the rest of my family,

426
00:38:06,128 --> 00:38:07,569
but I need another one for my father.

427
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:10,875
- I've been to all the firms and shops...
- Why didn't you come to me?

428
00:38:11,092 --> 00:38:13,240
I didn't know you were
in the certificate business.

429
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,012
I'm not, but Majorek is.

430
00:38:17,974 --> 00:38:19,851
Can you help? I have no money.

431
00:38:19,976 --> 00:38:23,438
Please, don't insult us.
Can you do something for him?

432
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:26,566
Be at the Schultz workshop tomorrow,
four o'clock.

433
00:38:26,649 --> 00:38:29,319
You see what a wonderful piece
of luck you've had today?

434
00:38:29,527 --> 00:38:33,406
That's the historical imperative
in action! That's why I always say:

435
00:38:33,573 --> 00:38:36,288
- Look on the bright side!
- The bright side, yes, I know.

436
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:51,424
- How's your back?
- Better.

437
00:38:51,883 --> 00:38:53,083
Better?

438
00:38:54,051 --> 00:38:55,595
Better not ask!

439
00:39:09,066 --> 00:39:14,531
- Thank you.
- My pleasure. Won't help you anyway.

440
00:39:16,616 --> 00:39:18,243
Thank you, Mr. Schultz.

441
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:32,359
Well, at least we got work in the ghetto.
Hey?

442
00:40:34,152 --> 00:40:35,653
At least we are still together.

443
00:40:50,627 --> 00:40:52,796
All out! Into the yard!

444
00:40:56,508 --> 00:41:00,303
We're all employed.
We've got work permits.

445
00:41:04,683 --> 00:41:06,810
Wait.

446
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,760
Here.

447
00:41:08,854 --> 00:41:11,106
Go over there. Hurry.

448
00:41:12,149 --> 00:41:13,349
You.

449
00:41:14,526 --> 00:41:16,862
You. You.

450
00:41:19,031 --> 00:41:20,231
You.

451
00:41:22,534 --> 00:41:23,734
You.

452
00:41:25,829 --> 00:41:27,029
You.

453
00:41:36,715 --> 00:41:40,135
The rest of you,
get dressed and report back here!

454
00:41:40,302 --> 00:41:42,638
Bring your belongings, only 15 kilos!

455
00:41:43,556 --> 00:41:45,724
Where are you taking us?

456
00:42:10,499 --> 00:42:12,042
I'm sorry, I did my best.

457
00:42:15,295 --> 00:42:17,248
I thought the certificates would save us.

458
00:42:17,297 --> 00:42:18,298
Stop it, Wladek.

459
00:42:18,382 --> 00:42:21,885
Let's just hope that Henryk
and Halina will be better off.

460
00:42:46,244 --> 00:42:47,495
Move on!

461
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:49,162
Come on, come on!

462
00:42:49,788 --> 00:42:52,124
- Where will we be going?
- You're going to work.

463
00:42:52,291 --> 00:42:55,378
You'll be much better off than
in the stinking ghetto. Move.

464
00:43:00,258 --> 00:43:04,011
Why did I do it?
Why did I do it?

465
00:43:05,304 --> 00:43:10,351
Why did I do it?
Why did I do it?

466
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:14,147
Why did I do it?

467
00:43:19,277 --> 00:43:24,532
Why did I do it?
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

468
00:43:26,575 --> 00:43:28,577
Why did I do it?

469
00:43:51,184 --> 00:43:53,727
I beg you,
don't you have a drop of water?

470
00:43:58,649 --> 00:44:01,319
Don't you have a drop of water?
He's dying.

471
00:44:01,945 --> 00:44:03,654
My child is dying of thirst.

472
00:44:03,779 --> 00:44:05,573
- I beg you. I beg you.
- I'm sorry.

473
00:44:05,656 --> 00:44:08,451
Don't you have a drop of water?
I beg you.

474
00:44:08,576 --> 00:44:09,535
Did you hear what I'm saying?

475
00:44:09,702 --> 00:44:12,179
- I'm telling you, it's a disgrace.
- I can hear you.

476
00:44:12,288 --> 00:44:14,728
We're letting them take us
to our death like sheep to the slaughter.

477
00:44:14,748 --> 00:44:16,709
- Not so loud.
- Why don't we attack them?

478
00:44:17,168 --> 00:44:20,264
There's half a million of us here.
We can break out of the ghetto.

479
00:44:20,504 --> 00:44:23,321
At least we can die honorably,
not as a stain on the face of history.

480
00:44:23,341 --> 00:44:25,573
Why are you so sure they're
sending us to our death?

481
00:44:25,593 --> 00:44:28,832
I'm not sure. You know why I'm not sure?
Because they didn't tell me.

482
00:44:29,472 --> 00:44:30,870
But I'm telling you,
they're going to wipe us all out.

483
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:33,456
Dr. Ehrlich, what do you want me to do?
Do you want me to fight?

484
00:44:33,476 --> 00:44:36,104
To fight, you need organization,
plans, guns.

485
00:44:36,229 --> 00:44:39,295
He's right. What do you think I
can do? Fight them with my violin bow?

486
00:44:39,315 --> 00:44:42,220
The Germans would never squander
a huge labor force like this.

487
00:44:42,693 --> 00:44:44,633
They're sending us to a labor camp,
it's obvious.

488
00:44:44,653 --> 00:44:45,853
Oh, sure.

489
00:44:46,197 --> 00:44:49,222
Look at that cripple there,
look at the old people, the children.

490
00:44:49,242 --> 00:44:50,442
They're gonna work?

491
00:44:50,869 --> 00:44:54,038
Look at you! Well, you're going to carry
iron girders on your back?

492
00:45:36,915 --> 00:45:40,001
Henryk! Halina, Henryk!

493
00:45:40,084 --> 00:45:42,462
Halina! Henryk!

494
00:45:45,173 --> 00:45:49,343
Oh my God!

495
00:45:49,761 --> 00:45:53,890
We heard you were here.
We wanted to be with you!

496
00:46:03,232 --> 00:46:04,776
We wanted to be with you!

497
00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:08,237
Stupid. Stupid.

498
00:46:08,321 --> 00:46:12,409
Why did I do it?
Why did I do it?

499
00:46:12,534 --> 00:46:14,578
She's getting on my nerves.

500
00:46:19,874 --> 00:46:24,546
- What did she do, for God's sake?
- She smothered her baby.

501
00:46:26,798 --> 00:46:29,926
They prepared a hiding place
and of course they went there.

502
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:33,597
But the baby cried
just as the police came.

503
00:46:34,013 --> 00:46:38,059
She smothered the cries with
her hands, the baby died.

504
00:46:39,436 --> 00:46:42,856
A policeman heard the death rattle
and found where they were hiding.

505
00:47:08,298 --> 00:47:09,674
What are you reading?

506
00:47:12,969 --> 00:47:17,891
"If you prick us, de we not bleed?
If you tickle us, do we not laugh?

507
00:47:18,058 --> 00:47:20,269
If you poison us, do we not die?

508
00:47:20,519 --> 00:47:23,230
And, if you wrong us,
shall we not revenge?"

509
00:47:31,238 --> 00:47:34,824
- Very appropriate.
- Yes. That's why I brought it.

510
00:47:52,509 --> 00:47:55,387
Idiot. What's he think he's
gonna do with the money?

511
00:47:57,222 --> 00:48:00,017
Hey boy, come here.

512
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:02,019
Come here.

513
00:48:03,896 --> 00:48:06,023
- How much for a caramel?
- Twenty zlotys.

514
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:09,756
What? For one caramel? What do you think
you're gonna do with the money?

515
00:48:09,776 --> 00:48:11,070
Twenty zlotys.

516
00:48:13,572 --> 00:48:15,740
We've got 20 between us.

517
00:48:15,908 --> 00:48:17,827
I've got ten, I think.

518
00:48:21,288 --> 00:48:22,998
Five, ten, twenty.

519
00:48:35,635 --> 00:48:37,637
Why did I do it?

520
00:49:00,285 --> 00:49:05,040
Why did I do it?
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

521
00:49:46,999 --> 00:49:49,835
- Halina?
- What?

522
00:49:51,211 --> 00:49:54,757
- It's a funny time to say this, but...
- What?

523
00:49:56,175 --> 00:49:58,010
I wish I knew you better.

524
00:50:02,348 --> 00:50:03,766
Thank you.

525
00:50:20,783 --> 00:50:23,536
Szpilman? Szpilman!

526
00:50:28,666 --> 00:50:31,586
Fuck off stupid! Go!

527
00:50:32,169 --> 00:50:34,672
Papa? Papa?

528
00:50:35,381 --> 00:50:39,051
Papa? Mama? Halina?

529
00:50:40,052 --> 00:50:42,096
Halina? Mama?

530
00:50:43,181 --> 00:50:47,518
What do you think you're doing Szpilman?
I've saved your life. Get out just go! Go!

531
00:50:51,814 --> 00:50:53,023
Don't run!

532
00:50:55,776 --> 00:51:00,281
Mama! Mama! Mama!

533
00:51:19,925 --> 00:51:24,139
- Well, off they go to the melting pot.
- Ah! Ja.

534
00:51:35,942 --> 00:51:38,319
What are you doing? She's pregnant!

535
00:54:05,967 --> 00:54:07,167
Wladek?

536
00:54:24,903 --> 00:54:28,490
Why are you here, Wladek?

537
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:32,077
It's like this, I, I...

538
00:54:33,745 --> 00:54:35,664
We...

539
00:54:37,958 --> 00:54:40,877
All of them, all of them.

540
00:54:41,044 --> 00:54:42,504
All of them.

541
00:54:44,423 --> 00:54:48,344
Perhaps they're lucky.
The quicker, the better.

542
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:51,680
It's not finished yet.
We'll stay here for a couple of days,

543
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:53,474
until things die down.

544
00:54:54,141 --> 00:54:56,727
I've bribed a policeman,
he'll come when it's over.

545
00:55:17,789 --> 00:55:21,002
My God, I haven't been outside in,
it must be two years.

546
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:23,045
Don't get overexcited.

547
00:55:39,937 --> 00:55:43,315
It's gold. Very good price.

548
00:56:04,378 --> 00:56:05,578
Someone you know?

549
00:56:06,463 --> 00:56:08,215
A beauty. Who is she?

550
00:56:08,757 --> 00:56:12,636
She's a singer. I knew her well actually.
Her husband's an actor.

551
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:15,514
They're good people.
I'd like to talk to her.

552
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:18,517
Don't forget, Wladek.
They hang them for helping Jews.

553
00:56:55,847 --> 00:56:59,100
- Stop!
- Halt!

554
00:58:57,552 --> 00:58:58,886
How long have you been here?

555
00:59:00,012 --> 00:59:01,306
Since last night.

556
00:59:03,141 --> 00:59:04,684
I was pleased to see you.

557
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:11,773
They're going to start
the final resettlement now.

558
00:59:14,652 --> 00:59:16,196
We know what it means.

559
00:59:18,281 --> 00:59:21,868
We sent someone out.
Zygmunt, a good man.

560
00:59:24,454 --> 00:59:26,835
His orders were to follow
the trains out of Warsaw.

561
00:59:29,292 --> 00:59:30,585
He got to Sokolow.

562
00:59:31,669 --> 00:59:34,297
A local railway man told
him the tracks divided,

563
00:59:34,547 --> 00:59:36,549
one branch leading to Treblinka.

564
00:59:38,218 --> 00:59:42,055
He said everyday freight trains
carrying people from Warsaw...

565
00:59:42,264 --> 00:59:45,392
branched off to Treblinka
and returned empty.

566
00:59:46,684 --> 00:59:48,970
No transports of food
are ever seen on that line.

567
00:59:50,272 --> 00:59:53,859
And civilians are forbidden
to approach the Treblinka station.

568
00:59:58,030 --> 00:59:59,531
They're exterminating us.

569
01:00:04,202 --> 01:00:05,829
It won't take them long.

570
01:00:08,248 --> 01:00:11,251
We're 60 thousand left,
out of half a million.

571
01:00:12,627 --> 01:00:14,171
Mostly young people.

572
01:00:16,464 --> 01:00:18,300
And this time we're gonna fight.

573
01:00:21,303 --> 01:00:22,679
We're in good shape.

574
01:00:24,264 --> 01:00:27,517
Organized. We're prepared.

575
01:00:28,393 --> 01:00:30,103
If you need help, I...

576
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:53,335
You! Come here!

577
01:00:54,837 --> 01:00:56,037
Shit!

578
01:01:04,888 --> 01:01:06,724
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

579
01:01:07,265 --> 01:01:09,768
I, I don't know what I was thinking.

580
01:01:39,214 --> 01:01:40,966
Get him away from here.

581
01:01:57,358 --> 01:02:00,569
I hope you play the piano better
than you carry bricks.

582
01:02:02,988 --> 01:02:05,324
He won't last long
if he goes on like this.

583
01:02:05,699 --> 01:02:08,327
I'll see if I can get him
something better.

584
01:02:31,267 --> 01:02:32,467
Trouble.

585
01:02:33,269 --> 01:02:35,938
Assemble! Fall in!

586
01:02:36,021 --> 01:02:38,816
Round up! Only the Jews.

587
01:02:39,192 --> 01:02:42,736
Poles go on working.
Only the Jews!

588
01:02:49,827 --> 01:02:52,413
I have good news for you.

589
01:02:52,996 --> 01:02:57,960
There are rumors going around
that we like to, uh...

590
01:02:58,169 --> 01:03:01,089
umsiedeln... Resettle you.

591
01:03:03,299 --> 01:03:08,012
I promise you that now
and in the future...

592
01:03:08,512 --> 01:03:11,015
nothing else is planned.

593
01:03:12,808 --> 01:03:19,523
Ja? For this reason, we put
information posters on the wall.

594
01:03:20,816 --> 01:03:24,153
To show you our goodwill...

595
01:03:24,278 --> 01:03:28,282
you should vote one of you
to be allowed...

596
01:03:28,449 --> 01:03:31,327
to go in town daily...

597
01:03:31,911 --> 01:03:37,959
and bring three kilos
of Kartoffeln potatoes, ja?

598
01:03:38,292 --> 01:03:42,421
And one loaf of bread
for each of your workers.

599
01:03:42,964 --> 01:03:48,302
So, why should we do something else
like this if we would resettle you?

600
01:03:49,512 --> 01:03:54,893
You can make good business
out of the things you don't eat.

601
01:03:56,352 --> 01:04:02,066
Isn't that something that you Jews
are good in? Make money?

602
01:04:06,029 --> 01:04:07,229
Carry on.

603
01:04:23,504 --> 01:04:27,466
That one, with the string.
The others, tied by wire.

604
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:37,570
Now!

605
01:06:15,074 --> 01:06:16,274
Majorek.

606
01:06:18,787 --> 01:06:20,372
I have a favor to ask.

607
01:06:22,081 --> 01:06:23,500
I want to get out of here.

608
01:06:27,421 --> 01:06:32,008
It's easy to get out. It's how you
survive on the other side that's hard.

609
01:06:32,091 --> 01:06:33,291
I know.

610
01:06:34,969 --> 01:06:39,224
Last summer, I worked for a day
in the Zelazna Brama Square.

611
01:06:39,308 --> 01:06:41,935
I saw someone I knew,
she's an old friend.

612
01:06:43,019 --> 01:06:45,189
A singer, her husband's an actor.

613
01:06:48,067 --> 01:06:52,154
I filled their names down
and their address, if they're still there.

614
01:06:52,362 --> 01:06:56,533
Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki.
They're good people.

615
01:06:58,243 --> 01:07:00,037
Would you try to make contact?

616
01:07:02,331 --> 01:07:03,332
You go to town every day.

617
01:07:03,415 --> 01:07:07,419
Would you just ask them, ask them
if they'd help me get out of here?

618
01:07:41,203 --> 01:07:42,997
Got a plaster?

619
01:07:52,965 --> 01:07:55,175
What are you up to?

620
01:07:57,887 --> 01:07:59,805
What's in that?

621
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:03,809
We're allowed to take food
into the ghetto.

622
01:08:05,019 --> 01:08:07,104
Three kilos of potato and bread.

623
01:08:07,897 --> 01:08:09,148
Open it.

624
01:08:13,235 --> 01:08:15,237
It's only potatoes and bread.

625
01:08:15,362 --> 01:08:18,490
You're lying. I can smell it.

626
01:08:20,034 --> 01:08:21,493
Open it.

627
01:08:50,355 --> 01:08:51,607
Potatoes!

628
01:08:55,945 --> 01:08:58,573
You Jews are all the same.

629
01:08:59,906 --> 01:09:02,493
Give a Jew your little finger...

630
01:09:03,034 --> 01:09:05,204
and he takes the whole hand.

631
01:09:19,635 --> 01:09:23,555
Lie to me again,
I'll shoot you... personally.

632
01:09:47,663 --> 01:09:49,248
I tried your friends.

633
01:09:50,165 --> 01:09:53,002
- They don't live there anymore.
- Did you make contact?

634
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:56,631
- Be ready to leave.
- When?

635
01:09:56,713 --> 01:09:58,383
- Soon.
- Halt!

636
01:09:59,509 --> 01:10:02,136
Oh, shit! Shit!

637
01:10:15,316 --> 01:10:18,485
I'll teach you discipline, you dirty pigs!

638
01:10:23,574 --> 01:10:25,285
Know why we're beating you?

639
01:10:25,826 --> 01:10:26,618
No.

640
01:10:26,702 --> 01:10:28,704
Know why we beat you?

641
01:10:29,371 --> 01:10:32,833
- Why?
- To celebrate New Year's Eve.

642
01:10:36,212 --> 01:10:38,505
No, quick march! March!

643
01:10:38,964 --> 01:10:41,092
March and sing!

644
01:10:42,093 --> 01:10:43,510
Sing something cheerful!

645
01:10:44,470 --> 01:10:46,513
Sing it loud and clear!

646
01:10:47,973 --> 01:10:51,977
♪ Hey ranks unite
and follow the white eagle ♪

647
01:10:52,144 --> 01:10:56,148
♪ Stand up and fight
our mortal enemies ♪

648
01:10:56,482 --> 01:11:00,527
♪ Riflemen, hey!
Let's give them fire and brimstone ♪

649
01:11:00,652 --> 01:11:04,531
♪ We'll blow away the yoke of slavery ♪

650
01:11:04,699 --> 01:11:08,453
♪ Punish and rout
the rapists of our nation ♪

651
01:11:08,619 --> 01:11:12,915
♪ We'll smash the knout
to save our dignity ♪

652
01:13:03,275 --> 01:13:04,527
I'm sorry.

653
01:13:04,695 --> 01:13:07,489
I'm dirty. I'm so filthy.

654
01:13:33,098 --> 01:13:35,308
We haven't much time. Come on.

655
01:13:43,691 --> 01:13:44,901
We must hurry.

656
01:13:45,736 --> 01:13:47,194
Here. See if these fit.

657
01:13:48,113 --> 01:13:49,927
We're going to have to keep moving you.

658
01:13:49,947 --> 01:13:52,368
The Germans are hunting
down indiscriminately now.

659
01:13:52,534 --> 01:13:55,746
Jews, non-Jews, anybody, everybody.

660
01:13:55,828 --> 01:13:59,832
And Wladek, you'd better shave.
Use my razor on the shelf.

661
01:14:14,765 --> 01:14:16,892
You'll be looked after
by Marek Gebczynski.

662
01:14:17,893 --> 01:14:19,477
He's on the other side of town.

663
01:14:20,061 --> 01:14:22,823
You stay there tonight,
then we'll find you somewhere else.

664
01:14:24,732 --> 01:14:28,154
- I'll bring you food.
- Alright, let's go.

665
01:15:08,069 --> 01:15:10,278
I'll show you where
you're going to sleep.

666
01:15:41,602 --> 01:15:44,312
You have to stay here
until tomorrow afternoon.

667
01:15:44,856 --> 01:15:49,401
We have a flat for you near
the ghetto wall. But it's safe.

668
01:15:56,993 --> 01:15:59,036
It's not going to be very comfortable.

669
01:16:00,037 --> 01:16:01,237
I'll be fine.

670
01:16:11,589 --> 01:16:12,800
Thank you.

671
01:16:29,651 --> 01:16:32,028
I'll take it. Here. Give it to me.

672
01:16:33,029 --> 01:16:36,073
Go as near to the front as possible,
to the German section.

673
01:16:55,133 --> 01:16:56,427
DO NOT PASS

674
01:17:28,209 --> 01:17:30,002
I'm going to draw the curtains now.

675
01:17:36,258 --> 01:17:39,261
But you leave them open
during the daytime. Don't forget.

676
01:17:42,974 --> 01:17:45,768
Must feel better on
this side of the wall, huh?

677
01:17:46,519 --> 01:17:47,719
Yes.

678
01:17:49,272 --> 01:17:52,566
But sometimes I'm still not sure
which side of the wall I'm on.

679
01:17:55,778 --> 01:17:58,697
Some bread, potatoes, onions.

680
01:17:59,532 --> 01:18:03,076
I'll come again. And Janina Bogucki
will visit twice a week.

681
01:18:03,161 --> 01:18:05,247
Bring more food, see how you are.

682
01:18:06,038 --> 01:18:07,238
Thank you.

683
01:18:09,333 --> 01:18:13,755
Oh, this is very important.
In case of emergency...

684
01:18:13,962 --> 01:18:17,466
I mean emergency, go to this address.

685
01:19:00,677 --> 01:19:03,180
Puppy dog, what do you mean you forgot?

686
01:19:03,305 --> 01:19:04,786
What do you think I mean, Kitten?

687
01:19:04,806 --> 01:19:06,265
I forgot, that's what I mean.

688
01:19:06,474 --> 01:19:08,936
You know what, you treat me like dirt.

689
01:19:09,061 --> 01:19:12,021
I treat you
like dirt because you are dirt.

690
01:19:12,105 --> 01:19:14,691
- Pig! Pig!
- Bitch!

691
01:19:14,983 --> 01:19:17,444
- Dirty pig!
- You are a dirty pig!

692
01:19:17,651 --> 01:19:19,612
Takes one to know one. Pig.

693
01:19:24,451 --> 01:19:26,911
Hmm. You play like an angel, Kitten.

694
01:19:27,079 --> 01:19:29,222
If I play like an angel,
why don't you listen?

695
01:19:29,663 --> 01:19:30,999
I was listening, Kitten.

696
01:19:31,124 --> 01:19:34,502
Liar!
You fell asleep. Pig!

697
01:22:47,321 --> 01:22:48,521
Thank you.

698
01:22:52,535 --> 01:22:55,829
- I wanted to come earlier, but...
- No, no, no, thank you.

699
01:22:59,792 --> 01:23:02,461
No-one thought they'd hold out so long.

700
01:23:03,753 --> 01:23:06,529
I never should have come out. I should've
stayed there and fought with them.

701
01:23:06,549 --> 01:23:09,928
Wladek, stop that. It's over now.

702
01:23:10,094 --> 01:23:12,137
Just be proud it happened.

703
01:23:13,263 --> 01:23:16,766
- My God, did they put up a fight!
- Yes.

704
01:23:18,853 --> 01:23:21,439
- So did the Germans.
- They're in shock!

705
01:23:21,856 --> 01:23:27,236
They didn't expect it.
Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back?

706
01:23:27,778 --> 01:23:31,740
- Who would have thought?
- What good did it do?

707
01:23:32,657 --> 01:23:34,159
What good?

708
01:23:35,035 --> 01:23:36,704
Wladek, I'm surprised at you.

709
01:23:37,621 --> 01:23:40,083
They died with dignity,
that's what good it did.

710
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:42,584
And you know something else?

711
01:23:43,293 --> 01:23:46,965
Now the Poles will rise. We're ready.

712
01:23:47,716 --> 01:23:50,634
We'll fight too. You'll see.

713
01:24:05,274 --> 01:24:08,277
Get your things together.
You have to leave.

714
01:24:08,361 --> 01:24:10,821
What? What's happened?

715
01:24:13,198 --> 01:24:15,660
- I'm on the run.
- What's happened?

716
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:19,830
The Gestapo found our weapons.
They've arrested Janina and Andrzej.

717
01:24:20,749 --> 01:24:24,753
They're bound to find out about this
place too. You must get away at once.

718
01:24:25,044 --> 01:24:26,330
Where do you want me to go?

719
01:24:27,380 --> 01:24:30,133
Look at me, I'm not leaving.

720
01:24:31,926 --> 01:24:34,679
- Can I take my chances here?
- That's your decision.

721
01:24:35,514 --> 01:24:38,348
But when they storm the flat,
throw yourself out the window,

722
01:24:38,517 --> 01:24:39,975
don't let them get you alive.

723
01:24:40,434 --> 01:24:42,896
I have poison on me.
They won't get me alive either.

724
01:28:00,094 --> 01:28:01,470
Open up!

725
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:07,684
Open this door
at once or we'll call the police!

726
01:28:37,213 --> 01:28:41,260
Are you from this flat?
You're not registered.

727
01:28:41,342 --> 01:28:42,302
It belongs to a friend of mine.

728
01:28:42,427 --> 01:28:44,910
I just came to visit,
but I must have just missed him.

729
01:28:44,930 --> 01:28:46,598
Have you got your identity card?

730
01:28:46,723 --> 01:28:47,923
What?

731
01:28:48,017 --> 01:28:50,351
- Let me see your identity card.
- Yes, of course.

732
01:28:53,354 --> 01:28:55,982
- I want to see your identity card!
- What's happening?

733
01:28:56,107 --> 01:28:58,359
He's a Jew! A Jew!

734
01:28:58,985 --> 01:29:00,862
Stop the Jew!

735
01:29:02,322 --> 01:29:04,825
Don't let him out! Stop him!

736
01:30:18,233 --> 01:30:21,943
- Yes?
- Mr. Gebczynski sent me.

737
01:30:28,618 --> 01:30:32,663
- Wladyslaw Szpilman.
- Dorota.

738
01:30:33,956 --> 01:30:35,375
Come in.

739
01:30:42,882 --> 01:30:45,051
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

740
01:30:45,135 --> 01:30:48,263
I was given this address
and I'm looking for a Mr. Dzikiewicz.

741
01:30:48,388 --> 01:30:51,348
Michal Dzikiewicz, he's my husband.

742
01:30:52,308 --> 01:30:53,518
Come in.

743
01:31:01,984 --> 01:31:03,184
Sit.

744
01:31:06,948 --> 01:31:08,324
I need help.

745
01:31:11,118 --> 01:31:12,578
He'll be back before curfew.

746
01:31:12,995 --> 01:31:15,791
I've... I've been in hiding.

747
01:31:18,043 --> 01:31:20,962
- I need somewhere to stay.
- He'll be here soon.

748
01:31:23,714 --> 01:31:26,884
- How long have you been married?
- Just over a year.

749
01:31:29,636 --> 01:31:31,807
And... how's Jurek?

750
01:31:32,473 --> 01:31:33,673
Dead.

751
01:31:34,434 --> 01:31:35,642
Oh...

752
01:31:40,816 --> 01:31:44,151
- And when, when is your baby due?
- Christmas.

753
01:31:45,277 --> 01:31:47,238
This is not a good time to have children,

754
01:31:47,363 --> 01:31:49,115
but then...

755
01:31:51,326 --> 01:31:54,830
This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman.

756
01:31:54,996 --> 01:31:59,166
- Marek Gebczynski sent him.
- Oh, yes, I remember.

757
01:32:01,837 --> 01:32:04,570
Mr. Gebczynski said to contact you
only in case of emergency.

758
01:32:04,590 --> 01:32:05,790
Don't worry now.

759
01:32:15,642 --> 01:32:18,854
We can't move you tonight.
You'll sleep on the sofa.

760
01:32:23,691 --> 01:32:25,486
Oh! Excuse me.

761
01:32:30,072 --> 01:32:32,493
I'm sorry, could I,
could I have a piece of bread?

762
01:32:33,325 --> 01:32:35,245
Yes, of course. We'll eat.

763
01:32:36,747 --> 01:32:39,541
Sit. Please, sit.

764
01:32:40,583 --> 01:32:41,959
Thank you.

765
01:34:50,797 --> 01:34:52,590
You're in a very German area.

766
01:34:54,051 --> 01:34:57,671
The building opposite is a hospital
taking in wounded from the Russian front.

767
01:35:00,223 --> 01:35:02,350
And next door is the Schutzpolizei.

768
01:35:04,978 --> 01:35:06,479
Safest place to be.

769
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:09,441
Right in the heart of the lion's den.

770
01:35:15,488 --> 01:35:16,865
I'll be locking you in.

771
01:35:17,866 --> 01:35:21,369
No-one knows you're here,
so keep as quiet as possible.

772
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:32,700
All well?

773
01:37:34,127 --> 01:37:35,327
Thank you.

774
01:37:40,759 --> 01:37:43,596
This is Antek Szalas.
He'll be looking after you.

775
01:37:44,722 --> 01:37:46,246
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

776
01:37:46,558 --> 01:37:47,758
Thank you.

777
01:37:48,601 --> 01:37:53,231
I've given him a second key. He'll
bring you food, see that you're alright.

778
01:37:54,107 --> 01:37:56,234
He's with the underground,
he's a good man.

779
01:38:00,779 --> 01:38:04,992
- You don't remember me Mr. Szpilman?
- I don't think so.

780
01:38:05,159 --> 01:38:08,662
Warsaw Radio. I was a technician.

781
01:38:09,247 --> 01:38:11,290
I saw you almost every day.

782
01:38:13,292 --> 01:38:16,004
- I'm sorry, I don't remember, I...
- It doesn't matter.

783
01:38:18,715 --> 01:38:21,843
You've nothing to worry about.
I'll visit often.

784
01:38:23,261 --> 01:38:26,078
You'll be pleased to hear that
the Allies are bombing Germany...

785
01:38:26,098 --> 01:38:28,100
night after night, after night.

786
01:38:28,475 --> 01:38:31,103
Cologne, Hamburg, Berlin.

787
01:38:31,185 --> 01:38:34,668
And the Russians are really giving
them hell. It's the beginning of the end.

788
01:38:34,688 --> 01:38:35,899
Oh, let's hope so.

789
01:39:22,654 --> 01:39:23,947
Still alive then?

790
01:39:28,786 --> 01:39:32,665
Here. Sausage, bread.

791
01:39:32,872 --> 01:39:34,498
You still got that vodka?

792
01:39:49,388 --> 01:39:52,935
- How long is this meant to last?
- Not long now.

793
01:39:54,268 --> 01:39:56,479
I think, I think I've got jaundice.

794
01:39:57,521 --> 01:40:01,359
Don't worry about that.
It just makes you look funny.

795
01:40:02,611 --> 01:40:05,948
My grandfather was jilted by
his girlfriend when he got jaundice.

796
01:40:06,824 --> 01:40:08,024
Drink up.

797
01:40:09,492 --> 01:40:12,746
Why didn't you come sooner?
It's been over two weeks.

798
01:40:12,830 --> 01:40:14,081
- I got...
- Problems.

799
01:40:14,832 --> 01:40:16,959
Money.

800
01:40:17,416 --> 01:40:19,418
I've got to raise money to buy the food.

801
01:40:20,128 --> 01:40:23,090
I need things to sell, it's not easy.

802
01:40:27,845 --> 01:40:30,013
Here. Sell this.

803
01:40:32,850 --> 01:40:34,977
Food's more important than time.

804
01:40:40,314 --> 01:40:43,486
Oh, yes. I meant to tell you!
The Allies have landed in France.

805
01:40:43,611 --> 01:40:45,488
Russians will be here soon.

806
01:40:46,364 --> 01:40:48,448
They'll beat the shit
out of the Germans...

807
01:40:50,199 --> 01:40:51,619
any day now.

808
01:41:36,079 --> 01:41:37,279
Wladek?

809
01:41:42,627 --> 01:41:43,827
Wladek?

810
01:41:47,382 --> 01:41:50,510
I knew it. I knew this would happen.

811
01:41:52,721 --> 01:41:55,198
- I'll get a doctor.
- You can't. It's too dangerous.

812
01:41:55,224 --> 01:41:58,207
- I'll get Dr. Luczak. We can trust him.
- Dorota. Don't be ridiculous,

813
01:41:58,227 --> 01:41:59,103
he's a pediatrician.

814
01:41:59,228 --> 01:42:01,230
- He's still a doctor.
- No.

815
01:42:01,980 --> 01:42:04,442
You stay. I'll go.

816
01:42:37,933 --> 01:42:39,809
We came to say goodbye.

817
01:42:41,020 --> 01:42:43,982
We're going to stay
with my mother in Otwocks.

818
01:42:44,232 --> 01:42:46,359
The baby's already there. It's safer.

819
01:42:47,692 --> 01:42:50,570
There's talk that the uprising
will begin any day now.

820
01:42:53,073 --> 01:42:55,618
That man Szalas should be shot.

821
01:42:56,995 --> 01:43:00,580
He's been collecting money
on your behalf all over Warsaw.

822
01:43:02,082 --> 01:43:06,880
Apparently people gave generously,
so he collected a tidy sum.

823
01:43:10,966 --> 01:43:12,467
My God.

824
01:43:17,347 --> 01:43:21,269
The liver the size of a football.
Acute inflammation of the gall bladder...

825
01:43:22,978 --> 01:43:24,229
but he'll live.

826
01:43:27,901 --> 01:43:31,404
I'll try to get him some levulose,
but it's not easy.

827
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:35,574
- Can you visit him again?
- Who knows.

828
01:43:36,116 --> 01:43:40,204
- Doctor, thank you.
- Don't speak, rest.

829
01:43:43,457 --> 01:43:45,168
Thank you so much for coming.

830
01:43:48,171 --> 01:43:49,547
We've brought you some food.

831
01:43:50,130 --> 01:43:53,301
I'll prepare something now for you,
then we must go.

832
01:46:58,653 --> 01:47:00,865
Get out, get out,
get out into the streets!

833
01:47:01,490 --> 01:47:04,618
Get out now! The Germans
have surrounded the building!

834
01:47:46,285 --> 01:47:50,164
Somebody... Somebody!
Somebody help me!

835
01:49:04,780 --> 01:49:07,783
Heinrich?

836
02:02:10,111 --> 02:02:11,487
What are you doing here?

837
02:02:16,951 --> 02:02:18,619
Who are you?

838
02:02:23,332 --> 02:02:26,669
- Understand?
- Yes.

839
02:02:29,047 --> 02:02:30,882
What are you doing?

840
02:02:35,762 --> 02:02:38,514
I, I was...

841
02:02:39,140 --> 02:02:41,642
trying to open this can.

842
02:02:42,936 --> 02:02:44,520
Do you live here?

843
02:02:48,024 --> 02:02:49,984
Do you work here?

844
02:02:50,193 --> 02:02:51,485
No.

845
02:02:55,531 --> 02:02:57,116
What do you do?

846
02:03:01,079 --> 02:03:02,279
I am...

847
02:03:04,498 --> 02:03:06,710
I was a pianist.

848
02:03:09,587 --> 02:03:10,922
Pianist?

849
02:03:30,525 --> 02:03:31,901
Come on.

850
02:03:57,677 --> 02:03:59,178
Play something.

851
02:09:19,084 --> 02:09:20,835
Are you hiding here?

852
02:09:26,799 --> 02:09:27,999
Jew?

853
02:09:31,179 --> 02:09:32,513
Where are you hiding?

854
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:36,800
In the attic.

855
02:09:40,438 --> 02:09:41,638
Show me.

856
02:10:06,172 --> 02:10:07,507
Got any food?

857
02:12:19,265 --> 02:12:20,557
Jew!

858
02:12:35,281 --> 02:12:36,657
Excuse me. Please.

859
02:12:37,241 --> 02:12:39,493
What's all that gunfire?

860
02:12:40,118 --> 02:12:42,246
Russians. Across the river.

861
02:12:44,165 --> 02:12:47,334
All you have to do is wait a few weeks.

862
02:14:18,968 --> 02:14:21,846
- What's happening?
- We're leaving.

863
02:14:24,681 --> 02:14:27,769
- Are the Russians here?
- Not yet.

864
02:14:30,938 --> 02:14:34,942
I... I don't know how to thank you.

865
02:14:36,318 --> 02:14:38,112
Thank God, not me.

866
02:14:38,946 --> 02:14:44,535
He wants us to survive.
Well, that's what we have to believe.

867
02:14:54,336 --> 02:14:56,923
Here. Take it.

868
02:14:58,758 --> 02:15:01,218
- And you?
- I've got another...

869
02:15:01,385 --> 02:15:03,012
a warmer one.

870
02:15:07,725 --> 02:15:10,269
What'll you do when it's all over?

871
02:15:12,855 --> 02:15:17,443
I'll play the piano again.
On the Polish radio.

872
02:15:18,069 --> 02:15:19,696
Tell me your name.

873
02:15:20,071 --> 02:15:21,948
I'll listen out for you.

874
02:15:22,907 --> 02:15:24,158
Szpilman.

875
02:15:25,409 --> 02:15:26,609
Szpilman.

876
02:15:29,539 --> 02:15:31,583
Good name for a pianist.

877
02:16:54,457 --> 02:16:57,419
German! German!

878
02:17:18,523 --> 02:17:20,025
No! No!

879
02:17:20,482 --> 02:17:23,070
No! Don't shoot! I'm, I'm Polish!

880
02:17:23,153 --> 02:17:24,987
Please! I'm Polish!

881
02:17:25,697 --> 02:17:26,897
I'm...

882
02:17:26,949 --> 02:17:28,365
Come out with your hands up!

883
02:17:28,450 --> 02:17:29,650
Please! I beg of you!

884
02:17:30,160 --> 02:17:35,040
Don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot.
I beg you, I'm a Polish, please.

885
02:17:35,122 --> 02:17:36,833
Come down!

886
02:17:40,712 --> 02:17:45,132
Please, I'm Polish! Please... please.

887
02:17:45,257 --> 02:17:46,457
He's Polish.

888
02:17:50,055 --> 02:17:52,099
Yes, he's Polish.

889
02:17:53,600 --> 02:17:55,227
Why the fucking coat?

890
02:17:57,104 --> 02:17:58,770
I'm cold.

891
02:18:18,583 --> 02:18:20,961
Look at them. German fuckers!

892
02:18:22,129 --> 02:18:24,922
Murderers! Murderers!

893
02:18:25,547 --> 02:18:28,676
- Dirty bastards!
- Assassins!

894
02:18:28,761 --> 02:18:31,764
- Bastards!
- Look at you now!

895
02:18:32,472 --> 02:18:36,183
You took everything I had.
Me, a musician.

896
02:18:36,393 --> 02:18:39,730
You took my violin, you took my soul!

897
02:18:44,610 --> 02:18:46,028
Musician?

898
02:18:47,487 --> 02:18:48,687
Musician?

899
02:18:49,697 --> 02:18:50,532
Yes.

900
02:18:50,616 --> 02:18:55,287
Do you know a pianist named Szpilman?

901
02:18:55,412 --> 02:18:56,872
Polish radio?

902
02:18:56,954 --> 02:18:58,791
Of course I know him.

903
02:18:58,874 --> 02:19:02,753
I helped him when
he was in hiding. Tell him I'm here.

904
02:19:02,878 --> 02:19:06,632
Ask him to help me.

905
02:19:10,467 --> 02:19:11,719
What's your name?

906
02:19:11,804 --> 02:19:13,430
Hosenfeld.

907
02:19:13,514 --> 02:19:16,849
What?

908
02:20:57,118 --> 02:20:58,994
It was here, I'm certain of it.

909
02:21:01,579 --> 02:21:03,206
Well, it's not here now.

910
02:21:03,956 --> 02:21:07,503
I shouted, abuse at them.
I'm not proud of it but that's what I did.

911
02:21:08,379 --> 02:21:10,332
And I'm certain
I stood where you are now.

912
02:21:10,506 --> 02:21:13,801
There was barbed wire,
and this German came up to me.

913
02:21:15,718 --> 02:21:18,471
- You didn't catch his name?
- No.

914
02:21:21,434 --> 02:21:23,720
I'll ask at the factory.
They may know something.
