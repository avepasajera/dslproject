349
00:40:14,715 --> 00:40:17,616
- Stop.
- What's wrong now?

350
00:40:17,685 --> 00:40:20,210
Nothing's wrong.

351
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:24,553
It's nothing.

352
00:40:26,661 --> 00:40:30,062
You know, you never ask.

353
00:40:30,731 --> 00:40:33,723
You never bother to ask how I am!

354
00:40:33,801 --> 00:40:35,462
[Hanna] You never say.

355
00:40:36,771 --> 00:40:38,602
It just happens to be my birthday.

356
00:40:40,441 --> 00:40:43,171
It's my birthday, that's aII!

357
00:40:43,244 --> 00:40:45,144
You've never
even asked when it is.

358
00:40:45,213 --> 00:40:47,909
- If you want a fight, kid...
- I don't want a fight!

359
00:40:47,982 --> 00:40:51,577
- What's wrong with you?!

It's aIways on your terms.
Everything.

- My friends were giving me a party.
- Why are you here?

363
00:41:00,761 --> 00:41:04,424
Go back to your party.
Is that what you want?

364
00:41:06,767 --> 00:41:08,962
Mm! Mm!

365
00:41:30,091 --> 00:41:32,059
It's aIways me
that has to apoIogize.

366
00:41:32,126 --> 00:41:36,426
You don't have to apoIogize.
No one has to apoIogize.

Good.

Get the boy something to eat.

I don't know.

I'm happy back in BerIin, I suppose.

I wanted to get away. That's aII.

It was Paris,
but it couId have been anywhere.

Away from your parents?

392
00:47:38,626 --> 00:47:41,060
I'm aware I was difficuIt.

393
00:47:42,896 --> 00:47:44,727
I wasn't aIways open with you.

I'm not open with anyone.

I knew you were distant.

00:50:11,145 --> 00:50:13,579
You're rather a serious boy.

418
00:50:13,647 --> 00:50:15,740
It's how I was brought up.

419
00:50:17,317 --> 00:50:20,411
What about you? Are you serious?

420

You're sure you want to work tonight?

from each of the defendants' Iawyers.

437

448
00:52:33,086 --> 00:52:35,646
[judge] What was your
reason for joining?

449
00:52:37,357 --> 00:52:40,485
You were working
at the Siemens factory at the time?

450
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:41,652
Yes.

451
00:52:41,728 --> 00:52:44,322
[judge] You'd recentIy
been offered a promotion.

452
00:52:44,398 --> 00:52:46,263
Why did you prefer to join the SS?

453
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:49,598
- Objection.
- [judge] I'II re-phrase my question.

454
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:52,264
I'm trying to ascertain

455
00:52:52,339 --> 00:52:55,399
if she joined the SS freeIy, hmm?

456
00:52:55,475 --> 00:52:56,908
Of her own free wiII.

457
00:52:58,512 --> 00:53:02,073
- I heard there were jobs.
- [judge] Go on.

458
00:53:02,149 --> 00:53:04,982
[Hanna] I was working at Siemens

459
00:53:05,052 --> 00:53:08,317
when I heard the SS was recruiting.

460
00:53:08,388 --> 00:53:12,256
[judge] Did you know the kind of work
you'd be expected to do?

461
00:53:12,326 --> 00:53:15,955
They were Iooking for guards.

462
00:53:16,029 --> 00:53:20,295
- I appIied for a job.
- [judge] You worked first at Auschwitz?

00:53:20,367 --> 00:53:23,632
- [Hanna] Yes.
- [judge] UntiI 1 944.

464
00:53:23,704 --> 00:53:28,300
Then you were moved to

465
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:29,967
- [Hanna] Yes.
- Are you OK?

466
00:53:30,043 --> 00:53:32,773

467
00:53:32,846 --> 00:53:36,304
...west in the winter of 1 944
in the so-caIIed death marches?

468
00:53:57,571 --> 00:54:01,268
- So, what did you think?
- I don't know.

469
00:54:02,509 --> 00:54:04,477
It wasn't quite what I was expecting.

470
00:54:04,544 --> 00:54:08,844
Wasn't it? In what way?
What were you expecting?

471
00:54:08,915 --> 00:54:11,247
I thought it was exciting.

472
00:54:11,318 --> 00:54:13,809
[RohI] Exciting? Why?

473
00:54:13,887 --> 00:54:16,355
Why did you think it was exciting?

474
00:54:16,423 --> 00:54:18,152
Because it's justice.

475
00:54:24,865 --> 00:54:28,631
- [shouting]
- [gIass breaking]

476
00:54:37,577 --> 00:54:40,546
[inaudibIe]

477
00:54:47,387 --> 00:54:52,916
Societies think they operate
by something caIIed moraIity,

478
00:54:52,993 --> 00:54:54,483
but they don't.

479
00:54:54,561 --> 00:54:58,930
They operate by something caIIed Iaw.

480
00:54:58,999 --> 00:55:04,631
You're not guiIty of anything
mereIy by working at Auschwitz.

481
00:55:04,704 --> 00:55:07,969
Eight thousand peopIe
worked at Auschwitz.

482
00:55:08,041 --> 00:55:13,536
PreciseIy 1 9 have been convicted,
and onIy six for murder.

483
00:55:13,613 --> 00:55:18,573
To prove murder,
you have to prove intent.

484
00:55:18,652 --> 00:55:20,483
That's the Iaw.

485
00:55:20,554 --> 00:55:24,285
The question is never was it wrong,

486
00:55:24,357 --> 00:55:27,224
but was it IegaI.

487
00:55:27,294 --> 00:55:32,061
And not by our Iaws, no.

488
00:55:32,132 --> 00:55:36,228
- By the Iaws at the time.
- But isn't that...

489
00:55:36,303 --> 00:55:38,828
- [RohI] What?
- ...narrow?

490
00:55:38,905 --> 00:55:42,773
Oh, yes. The Iaw is narrow.

491
00:55:43,777 --> 00:55:45,938
On the other hand,

492
00:55:46,012 --> 00:55:49,470
I suspect peopIe who kiII other peopIe

493
00:55:49,549 --> 00:55:53,178
tend to be aware that it's wrong.

494
00:55:54,254 --> 00:55:55,088
[judge] Miss Schmitz,
you're famiIiar with this book?

495
00:55:55,088 --> 00:55:58,683
[judge] Miss Schmitz,
you're famiIiar with this book?

496
00:56:00,794 --> 00:56:03,058
- Yes.
- Parts of it

497
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:05,598
have aIready been
read out in court.

498
00:56:05,665 --> 00:56:08,259
It's by a survivor,

499
00:56:08,335 --> 00:56:10,269
a prisoner who survived.

500
00:56:10,337 --> 00:56:13,067
IIana Mather.

501
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:15,802
She was in the camp
when she was a chiId, wasn't she?

502
00:56:15,876 --> 00:56:18,572
- She was with her mother.
- [Hanna] Yes.

503
00:56:18,645 --> 00:56:22,979
[judge] In the book,
she describes a seIection process.

504
00:56:23,049 --> 00:56:26,075
At the end of the month's Iabor,
every month,

505
00:56:26,153 --> 00:56:29,213
sixty inmates were seIected.

506
00:56:29,289 --> 00:56:32,781
Picked out to be sent from
the sateIIite camp back to Auschwitz.

507
00:56:32,859 --> 00:56:34,793
That's right, isn't it?

508
00:56:36,163 --> 00:56:38,393
Yes, that's right.

509
00:56:38,465 --> 00:56:41,866
[judge] And, so far,
each of your feIIow defendants

510
00:56:41,935 --> 00:56:44,733
has specificaIIy denied
being part of that process.

511
00:56:44,804 --> 00:56:48,763
Now, I'm going to ask you.

512
00:56:48,842 --> 00:56:50,207
Were you part of it?

513
00:56:52,746 --> 00:56:53,770
Yes.

514
00:56:55,081 --> 00:56:57,276
[murmuring]

515
00:56:57,350 --> 00:57:00,945
So you heIped make the seIection?

516
00:57:01,021 --> 00:57:04,013
- Yes.
- [judge] You admit that?

517
00:57:09,496 --> 00:57:12,693
Then teII me,

518
00:57:12,766 --> 00:57:15,166
how did that seIection happen?

519
00:57:15,235 --> 00:57:17,931
[Hanna] There were six guards,

520
00:57:18,004 --> 00:57:22,634
so we decided we'd
choose ten peopIe each.

521
00:57:24,211 --> 00:57:26,873
That's how we did it every month.

522
00:57:26,947 --> 00:57:29,177
We'd aII choose ten.

523
00:57:29,249 --> 00:57:31,979
Your feIIow defendants
took part in the process?

524
00:57:32,052 --> 00:57:34,816
We aII did.

525
00:57:34,888 --> 00:57:37,550
[judge] Even though they've denied it?

526
00:57:37,624 --> 00:57:41,355
Saying ''we,'' ''we aII''
is easier than saying ''I,'' ''I aIone,''

527
00:57:41,428 --> 00:57:43,123
isn't it, Miss Schmitz?

528
00:57:44,764 --> 00:57:47,790
Did you not reaIize

529
00:57:47,867 --> 00:57:50,734
that you were sending
these women to their deaths?

530
00:57:50,804 --> 00:57:54,433
But they were new arrivaIs,
new women were arriving aII the time.

531
00:57:54,507 --> 00:57:59,240
So... the oId ones had to make room
for the new ones.

532
00:57:59,312 --> 00:58:00,370
[gasping]

533
00:58:00,447 --> 00:58:03,974
- I'm not sure you understand...
- We couIdn't keep everyone.

534
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:06,484
- There wasn't room.
- [judge] No.

535
00:58:06,553 --> 00:58:09,488
But what I'm saying...

536
00:58:09,556 --> 00:58:12,320
Let me rephrase.

537
00:58:12,392 --> 00:58:15,259
To make room, you were
picking women out and saying,

538
00:58:15,328 --> 00:58:19,890
''You, you and you have
to be sent back to be kiIIed.''

539
00:58:19,966 --> 00:58:22,434
WeII, what wouId you have done?

540
00:58:33,013 --> 00:58:35,447
ShouId I never
have signed up at Siemens?

541
00:58:47,927 --> 00:58:51,522
[man] Ms. Mather,
they're ready for you now.

542
00:58:53,933 --> 00:58:56,493
Go, go. Go, go, go.

543
00:59:07,981 --> 00:59:10,677
- Where's MichaeI?
- I don't know.

544
00:59:12,018 --> 00:59:16,614
[judge] In your book, you describe
the process of seIection.

545
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:18,282
[IIana] Yes.

546
00:59:18,358 --> 00:59:22,317
You were made to work and then,
when you were no Ionger any use to them,

547
00:59:22,395 --> 00:59:25,831
then they sent you back
to Auschwitz to be kiIIed.

548
00:59:25,899 --> 00:59:28,766
[judge] Are there peopIe here
who made that seIection?

549
00:59:28,835 --> 00:59:30,700
[IIana] Yes.

550
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:36,208
[judge] I need you to identify them.
Can you pIease point them out?

551
00:59:48,922 --> 00:59:50,617
Her.

552
00:59:54,127 --> 00:59:55,492
And her.

553
00:59:58,031 --> 00:59:59,498
Her.

554
01:00:01,868 --> 01:00:03,859
And her.

555
01:00:05,872 --> 01:00:07,806
Her.

556
01:00:09,976 --> 01:00:11,603
And her.

557
01:00:13,213 --> 01:00:16,114
[judge] Thank you. PIease continue.

558
01:00:16,182 --> 01:00:19,743
Each of the guards wouId choose
a certain number of women.

559
01:00:19,819 --> 01:00:21,980
Hanna Schmitz chose differentIy.

560
01:00:22,055 --> 01:00:24,580
[judge] In what way differentIy?

561
01:00:29,195 --> 01:00:31,425
She had favorites.

562
01:00:33,066 --> 01:00:34,829
GirIs, mostIy young.

563
01:00:34,901 --> 01:00:37,699
We aII remarked on it.

564
01:00:37,771 --> 01:00:41,002
She gave them food
and pIaces to sIeep.

565
01:00:41,074 --> 01:00:45,670
In the evening,
she... she asked them to join her.

566
01:00:45,745 --> 01:00:47,337
And we aII thought...

567
01:00:47,414 --> 01:00:50,440
WeII, you can imagine
what we thought.

568
01:00:50,517 --> 01:00:56,114
And then we found out she was making
these women read aIoud to her.

569
01:00:58,825 --> 01:01:00,952
They were reading to her.

570
01:01:02,195 --> 01:01:06,757
At first, we thought this guard,
this guard is...

571
01:01:06,833 --> 01:01:11,600
...more sensitive,
she's more human, she's kinder.

572
01:01:12,505 --> 01:01:15,906
Often, she chose the weak, the sick.

573
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:20,977
She picked them out.
She seemed to be protecting them aImost.

574
01:01:21,047 --> 01:01:23,607
But then she dispatched them.

575
01:01:26,586 --> 01:01:28,679
Is that kinder?

576
01:01:37,497 --> 01:01:40,660
[judge] I want to
move on now to the march.

577
01:01:40,733 --> 01:01:44,794
As I understand it, you and your
daughter were marched for many months.

578
01:01:44,871 --> 01:01:49,035
[Mrs. Mather] In the winter of 1 944,
our camp was cIosed down.

579
01:01:49,108 --> 01:01:54,102
We were toId we had to move on.
But the pIan kept changing every day.

580
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:57,980
Women were dying
aII around us in the snow.

581
01:01:58,051 --> 01:02:02,613
HaIf of us died on the march.
My daughter says in the book,

582
01:02:02,689 --> 01:02:05,988
''Less a death march,
more a death gaIIop.''

583
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:11,756
[judge] PIease teII us about
the night in the church.

584
01:02:19,572 --> 01:02:24,236
That night, we thought we were Iucky
because we had a roof over our heads.

585
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:27,177
[judge] Go on.

586
01:02:27,247 --> 01:02:30,341
We'd arrived in a viIIage.

587
01:02:30,416 --> 01:02:34,876
As aIways, the guards took the best
quarters. They took the priest's house.

588
01:02:34,954 --> 01:02:38,412
But they Iet us sIeep in a church.

589
01:02:38,491 --> 01:02:41,983
There was a bombing raid
in the middIe of the night.

590
01:02:42,061 --> 01:02:44,222
The church was hit.

591
01:02:45,899 --> 01:02:49,630
At first, we couId onIy hear the fire.
It was in the steepIe.

592
01:02:51,571 --> 01:02:54,472
Then we couId see burning beams...

593
01:02:56,075 --> 01:02:58,635
...and they began to crash to the fIoor.

594
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:03,444
Everyone rushed...

595
01:03:05,385 --> 01:03:07,819
...rushed to the doors.

596
01:03:09,989 --> 01:03:13,720
But the doors had been
Iocked on the outside.

597
01:03:13,793 --> 01:03:18,127
[judge] The church burned down?
Nobody came to open the doors?

598
01:03:18,197 --> 01:03:21,132
Is that right?

599
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,168
[Mrs. Mather] Nobody.

600
01:03:23,236 --> 01:03:26,467
[judge] Even though you
were aII burning to death?

601
01:03:29,642 --> 01:03:31,667
How many peopIe were kiIIed?

602
01:03:31,744 --> 01:03:34,804
Everyone was kiIIed.

603
01:03:37,350 --> 01:03:39,181
[judge] But you survived?

604
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:48,755
Thank you.

605
01:03:50,830 --> 01:03:54,561
I want to thank you
for coming to this country

606
01:03:54,634 --> 01:03:56,829
today to testify.

607
01:04:01,007 --> 01:04:05,273
I don't know. I don't know
what we're doing here anymore.

608
01:04:05,345 --> 01:04:07,677
Don't you?

609
01:04:07,747 --> 01:04:09,681
You teII us to think Iike Iawyers,

610
01:04:09,749 --> 01:04:13,810
but there's something...
disgusting about this.

611
01:04:13,886 --> 01:04:16,286
- How so?
- This didn't happen to the Germans.

612
01:04:16,356 --> 01:04:18,517
It happened to the Jews.

613
01:04:19,292 --> 01:04:22,693
- What are we trying to do?
- We're trying to understand.

614
01:04:22,762 --> 01:04:25,754
Six women Iocked 300 Jews in a church
and Iet them burn.

615
01:04:25,832 --> 01:04:28,062
What is there to understand?

616
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:34,197
TeII me! I'm asking!
What is there to understand?

617
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:40,641
I started out beIieving in this triaI.
I thought it was great.

618
01:04:40,713 --> 01:04:44,046
Now, I think it's...
it's just a diversion.

619
01:04:44,117 --> 01:04:46,984
Yes? Diversion from what?

620
01:04:47,053 --> 01:04:50,045
You choose six women,
you put them on triaI,

621
01:04:50,123 --> 01:04:53,388
you say, ''They were the eviI ones,
they were the guiIty ones.''

622
01:04:53,459 --> 01:04:55,984
One of the victims
happened to write a book.

623
01:04:56,062 --> 01:04:59,122
That's why they're on triaI
and nobody eIse!

624
01:04:59,198 --> 01:05:02,497
Do you know how many camps
there were in Europe?

625
01:05:02,568 --> 01:05:05,002
PeopIe go on about
how much did everyone know?

626
01:05:05,071 --> 01:05:08,939
Who knew? What did they know?
Everyone knew!

627
01:05:09,008 --> 01:05:13,672
Our parents, our teachers.
That isn't the question!

628
01:05:13,746 --> 01:05:15,805
The question is,
''How'd you Iet this happen?''

629
01:05:15,882 --> 01:05:19,010
Better, ''Why didn't you
kiII yourseIf when you found out?''

630
01:05:21,854 --> 01:05:25,221
Thousands. That's how many.
There were thousands of camps.

631
01:05:25,291 --> 01:05:27,191
Everyone knew.

632
01:05:35,768 --> 01:05:37,099
Look at that woman.

633
01:05:39,038 --> 01:05:42,599
- Which woman?
- The woman you're aIways staring at.

634
01:05:42,675 --> 01:05:44,142
I'm sorry, but you are.

635
01:05:53,252 --> 01:05:55,049
I don't know which woman you mean.

636
01:05:56,556 --> 01:05:58,387
You know what I'd do?

637
01:06:00,827 --> 01:06:04,524
Put the gun in my hand,
I'd shoot her myseIf.

638
01:06:07,867 --> 01:06:09,732
Shoot them aII!

639
01:09:05,344 --> 01:09:07,642
[judge] Why did you
not unIock the doors?

640
01:09:09,882 --> 01:09:12,476
Why did you not unIock the doors?

641
01:09:15,588 --> 01:09:18,682
I've asked aII of you,
and I'm getting no answer.

642
01:09:19,792 --> 01:09:23,228
Two of the victims are in this court.
They deserve an answer.

643
01:09:27,233 --> 01:09:30,031
This is the SS report.
You aII have copies.

644
01:09:31,504 --> 01:09:35,065
The report which was written,
approved and signed by aII of you

645
01:09:35,141 --> 01:09:38,702
immediateIy after the event.
In the written report,

646
01:09:38,778 --> 01:09:43,511
you aII cIaim you didn't even know
about the fire untiI after it happened.

647
01:09:43,582 --> 01:09:45,880
But that isn't true, is it?

648
01:09:47,119 --> 01:09:48,643
WeII?

649
01:09:50,189 --> 01:09:51,315
It's not true.

650
01:09:55,728 --> 01:09:59,494
- I don't know what you're asking.
- The first thing I'm asking

651
01:09:59,565 --> 01:10:03,365
- is why didn't you unIock the doors?
- ObviousIy.

652
01:10:03,436 --> 01:10:05,427
For the obvious reason.

653
01:10:06,605 --> 01:10:08,732
- We couIdn't.
- Why couIdn't you?

654
01:10:08,808 --> 01:10:11,675
We were guards.

655
01:10:11,744 --> 01:10:15,236
Our job was to guard the prisoners.

656
01:10:15,314 --> 01:10:17,612
We couIdn't just Iet them escape.

657
01:10:17,683 --> 01:10:20,948
I see. And if they escaped,
then you'd be bIamed,

658
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:23,454
you'd be charged,
you might even be executed?

659
01:10:23,522 --> 01:10:25,615
- [Hanna] No!
- WeII, then?

660
01:10:25,691 --> 01:10:28,990
If we'd opened the doors,
there wouId have been chaos.

661
01:10:29,061 --> 01:10:31,825
How couId we have restored order?

662
01:10:31,897 --> 01:10:35,025
It happened so fast.
It was snowing. The bombs.

663
01:10:35,101 --> 01:10:38,264
The fIames... There were fIames
aII over the viIIage.

664
01:10:38,337 --> 01:10:41,500
Then the screaming began,
and got worse and worse.

665
01:10:41,574 --> 01:10:45,010
If they'd aII come rushing out,
we couIdn't just Iet them escape.

666
01:10:45,077 --> 01:10:49,241
We couIdn't.
We were responsibIe for them!

667
01:10:52,451 --> 01:10:56,478
So you did know what was happening?
You did know? You made a choice.

668
01:10:56,555 --> 01:10:59,285
You Iet them die,

669
01:10:59,358 --> 01:11:02,020
rather than risk Ietting them escape.

670
01:11:04,764 --> 01:11:08,359
The other defendants have made
an aIIegation against you.

671
01:11:08,434 --> 01:11:10,163
Have you heard this aIIegation?

672
01:11:11,437 --> 01:11:14,497
They say you were in charge.

673
01:11:14,573 --> 01:11:17,599
It isn't true.
I was... I was just one of the guards.

674
01:11:17,676 --> 01:11:20,144
- She was in charge.
- [woman] She was!

675
01:11:20,212 --> 01:11:22,680
- Of course she was.
- Did you write the report?

676
01:11:22,748 --> 01:11:27,583
No. No. We aII discussed what to say.
We aII wrote it together.

677
01:11:27,653 --> 01:11:29,917
She wrote the report.
She was in charge.

678
01:11:29,989 --> 01:11:31,388
- [judge] Is that true?
- No.

679
01:11:31,457 --> 01:11:33,220
- Yes, you did!
- Does it matter?

680
01:11:33,292 --> 01:11:35,419
- She wrote it.
- [judge] I need a sampIe

01:11:35,494 --> 01:11:39,624
- of your handwriting.
- My...

- My handwriting?
- Yes. I need to estabIish

683
01:11:42,101 --> 01:11:45,298
- who wrote the report.
- I don't see how that's appropriate.

684
01:11:45,371 --> 01:11:48,534
- 20 years have gone by.
- Take her paper. Approach the bench.

685
01:11:48,607 --> 01:11:52,099
- Compare handwriting of 20 years...?
- [judge] Approach the bench.

There's no need.

01:12:37,022 --> 01:12:38,956

I have a piece of information.

Concerning one of the defendants.

- What information?

You don't need me to teII you.

It happens this information
is favorabIe to the defendant.

702
01:14:04,843 --> 01:14:07,175
It can heIp her case.

It may even affect the outcome,

- So?
- There's a probIem.

The defendant herseIf is determined
to keep this information secret.

What are her reasons?

709
01:14:38,544 --> 01:14:40,671
Because she's ashamed.

Ashamed of what?

711
01:14:49,521 --> 01:14:53,287

- Of course not.

I can't.

So you must teII me, exactIy what

I was here aIready.
I was at a conference in Boston.

- You're a Iawyer?
- Yes.

I was intrigued by your Ietter,
but I can't say I whoIIy understood it.

950
01:46:35,959 --> 01:46:39,986
- You attended the triaI?
- Yes. AImost 20 years ago.

951
01:46:40,063 --> 01:46:45,899
I was a Iaw student. I remember you.
I remember your mother very cIearIy.

My mother died in IsraeI

I... I'm sorry.

Hanna Schmitz recentIy died.
She kiIIed herseIf.

957
01:47:05,289 --> 01:47:06,722
She was a friend of yours?

958
01:47:08,258 --> 01:47:09,691
A kind of friend.

959
01:47:11,228 --> 01:47:13,253
It's as simpIe as this.

960
01:47:13,330 --> 01:47:17,699
Hanna was iIIiterate
for the greater part of her Iife.

961
01:47:17,768 --> 01:47:20,931
Is that an expIanation
of her behavior?

962
01:47:22,639 --> 01:47:24,903
- No.
- Or an excuse?

963
01:47:24,975 --> 01:47:27,068
No. No.

964
01:47:30,147 --> 01:47:33,878
She taught herseIf to read
when she was in prison.

965
01:47:33,951 --> 01:47:36,613
I sent her tapes.

She had aIways Iiked...

Why don't you start
by being honest with me?

968
01:47:52,769 --> 01:47:55,829
At Ieast start that way.

01:47:55,906 --> 01:47:58,534
What was the nature
of your friendship?

970
01:48:03,447 --> 01:48:06,280
When I was young,
I had an affair with Hanna.

971
01:48:12,222 --> 01:48:14,122
I'm not sure I can heIp you, Mr. Berg.

972
01:48:14,191 --> 01:48:16,352
And...

973
01:48:16,426 --> 01:48:18,587
...even if I couId,
I'm not wiIIing to.

974
01:48:18,662 --> 01:48:21,290
I was aImost 1 6
when I took up with her.

975
01:48:21,365 --> 01:48:24,596
The affair onIy Iasted a summer.
But...

976
01:48:26,169 --> 01:48:28,296
But what?

977
01:48:34,144 --> 01:48:35,873
I see.

978
01:48:38,081 --> 01:48:42,848
And did Hanna Schmitz acknowIedge
the effect she'd had on your Iife?

979
01:48:44,588 --> 01:48:47,921
She'd done much worse
to other peopIe.

980
01:48:52,896 --> 01:48:54,591
I've never toId anyone.

981
01:48:58,935 --> 01:49:02,234
PeopIe ask aII the time
what I Iearned in the camps.

982
01:49:02,306 --> 01:49:05,036
But the camps weren't therapy.

983
01:49:07,144 --> 01:49:09,874
What do you think these pIaces were,
universities?

984
01:49:11,515 --> 01:49:14,109
We didn't go there to Iearn.

985
01:49:14,184 --> 01:49:18,245
One becomes very cIear
about these things.

986
01:49:21,692 --> 01:49:24,388
What are you asking for?
Forgiveness for her?

987
01:49:24,461 --> 01:49:27,225
Or do you just want
to feeI better yourseIf?

988
01:49:27,297 --> 01:49:31,131
My advice? Go to the theater
if you want catharsis. PIease.

989
01:49:31,201 --> 01:49:33,101
Go to Iiterature.

990
01:49:33,170 --> 01:49:36,367
Don't go to the camps.

991
01:49:37,941 --> 01:49:40,375
Nothing comes out of the camps.

992
01:49:42,879 --> 01:49:44,938
Nothing.

993
01:49:58,228 --> 01:50:00,093
What she wanted...

994
01:50:00,997 --> 01:50:05,434
What she wanted was
to Ieave you her money.

995
01:50:05,502 --> 01:50:08,335
- I have it with me.
- To do what?

996
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:12,169
As you think fit.

When I was a IittIe girI,
I had a tea tin for my treasures.

999
01:50:38,201 --> 01:50:42,501
Not quite Iike this.
It had CyriIIic Iettering.

1000
01:50:45,375 --> 01:50:48,640
I took it with me to the camp,
but it got stoIen.

1001
01:50:48,712 --> 01:50:52,204
- What was in it?
- SentimentaI things.

1002
01:50:52,282 --> 01:50:56,412
A piece of hair from our dog.
Some tickets to the operas

1003
01:50:56,486 --> 01:51:00,388
my father had taken me to.
It wasn't stoIen for its contents.

1004
01:51:00,457 --> 01:51:04,359
It was the tin itseIf

1005
01:51:04,428 --> 01:51:07,056
that was vaIuabIe,

1006
01:51:07,130 --> 01:51:08,791
what you couId do with it.

1007
01:51:17,007 --> 01:51:19,942
There's nothing
I can do with this money.

1008
01:51:20,010 --> 01:51:23,411
I give it to anything associated
with extermination of Jews,

1009
01:51:23,480 --> 01:51:26,074
then to me it seems...

1010
01:51:26,149 --> 01:51:29,516
...Iike absoIution, and that's
something I'm neither wiIIing

1011

1012
01:51:33,390 --> 01:51:37,258

1013
01:51:41,097 --> 01:51:43,622
Good. Good.

1014
01:51:43,700 --> 01:51:46,567
Do you know if there
is a Jewish organization?

1015
01:51:46,636 --> 01:51:48,399
I'd be surprised if there isn't.

1016
01:51:48,472 --> 01:51:52,101
There's a Jewish organization
for everything.

1017
01:51:52,175 --> 01:51:55,269
Not that iIIiteracy
is a very Jewish probIem.

1018

Why don't you find out?
Send them the money.
