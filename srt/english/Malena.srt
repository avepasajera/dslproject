1
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,500
This afternoon at 5:00

2
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,300
Il Duce will speak
to the nation!

3
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,900
You are ordered
to turn your radios on!

4
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,500
All of you who have radio sets
and radio gramophones

5
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,500
are ordered to turn them on.

6
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,500
Mussolini will speak
to all Italians!

7
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,900
You are authorised by order
of the Fascist government

8
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
to interrupt your work.

9
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,900
This afternoon at 5:00

10
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,400
Il Duce will speak
to the nation.

11
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,300
I was twelve and a half
when I saw her for the first time.

12
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,000
Even though I'm older now

13
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,000
and my mind plays tricks on me,
I remember it well.

14
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:15,000
Τhat day, Mussolini declared war
on France and Great Britain

15
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,700
and I got my first bicycle.

16
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,100
The frame is British,

17
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,100
the gears are French,

18
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,800
and the brakes are from...
I forget.

19
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,800
But the chain is Sicilian...
always keep it greasy.

20
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,100
- Are you sure it's safe?
- I have new bikes too.

21
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,600
Mimi, we're at war.
Who can afford a new bicycle?

22
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,900
Fighting men...

23
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,600
on land, on sea
and in the air,

24
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,500
Blackshirts of the revolution,

25
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,300
men and women of Italy
and the Kingdom of Albania

26
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,000
hear this...

27
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,100
Except for my father, who wasn't
very fond of "Our Great Leader"

28
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,000
everyone in town was happy
that Italy was going to war.

29
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,200
Maybe they couldn't see,
and I surely couldn't have known

30
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,400
how that day would
mark my life forever.

31
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,800
The hour...

32
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,600
of decisions from which
there is no return.

33
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,200
Pino, think this ant knows
he's dead meat?

34
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,300
Who knows?

35
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,600
If he's like you,
he doesn't know shit.

36
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,300
The declaration of war

37
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,300
has already been delivered
to the ambassadors.

38
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,600
I'm free from misery.
Mary's son is my Lord.

39
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,300
Hey, guys!

40
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,000
Lucky bastard,
he's got a new bicycle!

41
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,500
Man, she's beautiful!

42
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,500
It's almost brand new.

43
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,800
Custom-made,
just like the racers.

44
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,700
- Now you're a man, like us.
- So I can join the gang?

45
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,900
- "Don Agostino"?
- Okay by me.

46
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,900
- "Don Nicola"?
- I'd let him in.

47
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,000
- "Don Tonino"?
- Sure.

48
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,400
And you, "Don Sasa"?

49
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,200
I don't want some kid
poking into our business.

50
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,100
- Why? What are you doing?
- Can you keep your mouth shut?

51
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,400
She's coming!

52
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,200
What's going on?

53
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,000
If you wanna be one of us,
just shut up and watch.

54
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
Who is she?

55
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,700
The deaf guy's daughter,
our new Latin teacher.

56
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,100
- What's her name?
- What a wonderful ass!

57
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,100
What I wouldn't give
for an hour with her!

58
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,100
- Too bad she's married.
- If she weren't...

59
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,700
What's her name?

60
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,800
Malena, the most beautiful ass
in Castelcuto.

61
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,600
The sun is bigger
than the moon.

62
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,600
Sol maior est quam lunam.

63
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,800
Or sol maior est luna.

64
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,400
Can I screw your daughter,
you deaf old fart?

65
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,100
Yes, but hurry.

66
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,600
I love honesty
more than wealth.

67
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,900
Seven thumbs long!

68
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,200
- Seven and a half thumbs!
- Mine's a bazooka!

69
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,900
- I got eight!
- Eight is nothing!

70
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,100
That's just tickling a woman!

71
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,900
One, two... three and two is five,
two is seven and two is nine.

72
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,400
Torpedo!

73
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,600
My submarine
will rip Malena in half!

74
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,300
Once I skipped school
and went by Malena's house.

75
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,400
She was at the window,
and she called out to me.

76
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,600
I thought she wanted me
to get her some cigarettes.

77
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,400
I went up for the money,
and her robe fell open.

78
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,800
And there she was,

79
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,600
naked as the day
she was born.

80
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,800
Holy shit!

81
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,900
She did it on purpose
to excite me.

82
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,100
I was an idiot.
I should have jumped at the chance.

83
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,000
If it happens again,
I'll bang her brains out.

84
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,800
She'd quit smoking first.
She knows you've got no balls.

85
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,500
You little runt,
you've been here for two hours

86
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,300
and you still haven't
measured yourself.

87
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,700
Measure it!

88
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,500
One, two...

89
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,500
three, four...

90
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,000
five...

91
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,300
Only six!

92
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,000
You know what they say
about a kid in short pants?

93
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,100
Short pants: short dick!

94
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,300
Fuck off. My thumbs are twice
as big as yours!

95
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,700
Bullshit!

96
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,300
Who's got the biggest dick
now, runt?

97
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,500
You do!

98
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,600
No, I am Il Duce!
Nobody's bigger than me!

99
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,900
- Ooh. Renato's skipping school.
- Shh!

100
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,200
You, come here!
I need some cigarettes.

101
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,600
What cigarettes do you want?

102
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
Macedonia Extra.

103
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,200
I remember this suit very well.
It's your father's.

104
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,200
I sewed it 20 years ago,
and it still looks brand new.

105
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,100
He only wore it to his wedding.
He wants to keep it for his funeral.

106
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,800
If he's buried in this suit,
he'll go straight to heaven!

107
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:56,600
- My father's still young.
- And you're too young for long pants.

108
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,100
I didn't ask
for your opinion, sir.

109
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,700
- Does he know about this?
- Of course he does!

110
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,900
You little scoundrel,
what the hell is this?

111
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,500
Come here, mister.

112
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,700
So you want to skip school?

113
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,300
Fine. Who didn't at your age?

114
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,900
Leave him alone!

115
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,700
I know what I'm doing.

116
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,800
And you let your friends
beat you up.

117
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,900
Fair enough.

118
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,500
Even though when I was your age,
I'd beat my friends up!

119
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,700
But stealing trousers
from your father

120
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,500
and getting them altered
for yourself

121
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,300
is just plain wrong!

122
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,100
But, Papa,
you don't understand!

123
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,200
Understand?
Who said you could speak?

124
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,600
I'm ashamed
to wear short pants!

125
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,800
What about knickers?
They're almost long pants!

126
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,600
Enough! He's still a child!

127
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:51,500
I'll tell our party secretary you won't
let me go to the Fascist exercises.

128
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,000
Let's make a deal:

129
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:05,000
The day someone cracks the skull
of "Our Great Leader"...

130
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,800
then you'll get long pants.

131
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,300
Swear it.

132
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,600
A beautiful young woman
all alone here. It's a crime.

133
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,000
- Who's he talking about?
- Malena Scordia, Nino's sexy new wife.

134
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,200
She must have somebody on the side,
it's inevitable!

135
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,900
- Number fifteen!
- Me.

136
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,100
Right. Nino brings her from her village
with her ailing father.

137
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,200
And then a month later, boom...
Nino's called to the war.

138
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,900
Who here wants to bet
she's sleeping all alone?

139
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,500
Not me!

140
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,900
Why don't you let me
sit with the others?

141
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,500
You're too young
to sit in the adult chair.

142
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
- Good night, comrade.
- Hey, who's out after curfew?

143
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,500
Ah, it's you, Roberto.

144
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,100
And on the home front,

145
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,100
report of fuel and food shortages
are beginning to mount.

146
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:24,000
In the islands
and outlying areas

147
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:28,100
rationing of flour and sugar
will continue...

148
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,000
But, son, if you don't know the title,
how can I help you?

149
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,600
It's that pretty, romantic one...

150
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:09,100
"Ma L'Amore No".
Why didn't you say so?

151
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,400
Ten lire.
Pay at the cashier's.

152
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,200
- Don't you test it?
- What for?

153
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,600
- It might be defective.
- It's brand new!

154
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,700
Miss Malena,
this heart of mine, on fire,

155
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,800
has written so many letters

156
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,400
and if I didn't have the courage
to send them to you

157
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,700
it was only because I didn't want
to do you harm.

158
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,300
So forgive me if I dare
to send you this one.

159
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,600
I want you to know
that this town has many gossips,

160
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:09,300
who say bad things about you...
that you have a secret lover.

161
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,200
I know it's not true.

162
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,900
You don't have anyone.

163
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,300
After your husband,
the only man in your life is me.

164
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,500
I have to go. I'll see you
at school tomorrow.

165
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,900
So long!

166
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Don't get lost!

167
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Malena's up
in the employment office.

168
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,500
- Looking for a job again?
- But who will ever hire her?

169
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,500
No one in this town.

170
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,200
I've got a job for her...

171
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,300
Little boy, let me get by.

172
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,600
Hey, baby,
give a soldier a break!

173
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,300
Mr Lawyer!
Your newspaper's upside down!

174
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,500
Mind your own fucking business!

175
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,800
Good morning, Signora Malena,
are you well?

176
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,400
How is your father?
May I?

177
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:16,600
The show's over!
She's gone now!

178
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,400
I forgot the key!

179
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,200
So it's true what people say!

180
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,600
What's the matter with you?
You look so strange.

181
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,200
You've poisoned me
with your lies.

182
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,500
What lies?
I've never spoken to you.

183
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:19,000
I knew it from the start...
you're a loose woman.

184
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,100
But I've never
done anything wrong.

185
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,200
Liar! I've been following you
on my bicycle!

186
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,200
I know where you went.
I know everything!

187
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,100
- Τhe lawyer, the dentist!
- No, Renato, I love only you!

188
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,800
Liar!

189
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,200
- Amoroso.
- Here!

190
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,900
- Cali.
- Here!

191
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,400
- Costanza.
- Here!

192
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,200
Professor, can I put my dick
between Malena's tits?

193
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,700
Can I put mine in her mouth?

194
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,800
Can I put mine
between her legs?

195
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,200
Okay, but one at a time!

196
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,300
You're all sons of bitches!

197
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,300
Why didn't she marry someone
from her own village?

198
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,900
I'm sure no one wanted her.

199
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,100
- They say she's a seamstress.
- But she's so vulgar.

200
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,100
My son says she looks fake.

201
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,600
My husband says he wouldn't touch her
with a ten-foot pole.

202
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,900
The Baron Bonta's mistress
is much nicer.

203
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,100
At least Gina does everything
in the open.

204
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:45,300
The baron screws her once a week
and then goes back to Palermo.

205
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,200
Malena acts so superior.
Like we don't know what she's up to.

206
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,200
Wait and see.
She'll get hers.

207
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:40,700
The headquarters
of the armed forces communicates:

208
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:44,600
"Our brave and invincible fighting men
have delivered a powerful blow

209
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,200
"to the faceless war machine
unleashed by the Allies.

210
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:51,300
"In order to ensure
the continued strength and vitality,

211
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,400
"of our forces at the front,

212
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,600
"all payment of civic pensions

213
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:01,300
"will again be postponed..."

214
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,300
It's ready.

215
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,600
Thank you.

216
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,700
It's not much,
but it's all we can afford.

217
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,900
Me Tarzan, you Malena.

218
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,400
Renato, you've got the biggest gun
in the West!

219
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,300
You're going to go blind!

220
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,500
Right rank!

221
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,500
Eyes front! Arms out, arms high,
in quick succession!

222
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,300
Have you heard?
Malena's husband was killed.

223
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,700
My father told me.
He read the telegram.

224
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,000
Malena is available!

225
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,300
Comrades of Castelcuto,

226
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,600
we are gathered here today

227
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,900
to share in the tragic
but honourable mourning

228
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,800
which has struck our town.

229
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,900
To express our deepest condolences

230
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,900
for the loss
of Lt Nino Scordia,

231
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,700
heroically killed in action

232
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,800
in Northern Africa...

233
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,900
...and to his bride Maddalena

234
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,800
who, stricken with grief,
unfortunately isn't here with us.

235
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,700
- She's already out looking!
- She'll need a warm bed now!

236
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,500
But she is with us in spirit

237
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,000
because Sicilian women,

238
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,100
with their hardships,
with their sacrifices,

239
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,100
march shoulder to shoulder
with fighting men.

240
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:30,400
The martyrdom of our fellow citizen
in defence of his country

241
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,500
was not a useless sacrifice.

242
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:37,400
- Lt Cadei is so handsome.
- A lucky girl will catch him!

243
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:42,500
...that will carry us to the
final victory of the Fascist Empire!

244
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,000
Long live Il Duce!

245
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,100
From now on
I'll be at your side.

246
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,000
Forever. I promise.

247
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,500
Just give me time to grow up.

248
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,900
Now she'll take a lover
for sure!

249
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
"Once in the sack,
there's no looking back!"

250
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,100
She knows that.
She's 27 years old.

251
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,900
She knows her way
around the block!

252
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,900
Cusimano, the dentist,
has gone crazy for her.

253
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,300
One day he was distracted
as she walked by

254
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:54,300
and pulled a healthy tooth
instead of the rotten one!

255
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,600
Dentist or not,
why haven't we seen her lately?

256
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,900
Guess she's too busy!

257
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,800
They say she's fooling around
with a shopkeeper in Catania

258
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,400
with subversive tendencies.

259
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,800
Some say Cusimano,
the dentist.

260
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:17,800
- A family man. It's disgraceful!
- When you're a born whore...

261
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:22,200
I hear the priest
has received anonymous letters

262
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,900
saying her lover
is this man, that man.

263
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,800
The voice of the people
is the voice of God!

264
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,200
I can't talk to anyone
about my personal problems.

265
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,800
They're too intimate.

266
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:10,000
But you seem nice.
I'd like to confide in you.

267
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,300
Every day,
I'll light a candle for you.

268
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,700
I'll even come to Mass
on Sunday.

269
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:26,300
But you must protect Malena Scordia
from the town.

270
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:30,100
Yes, the widow... at least for a few years.
Then I'll take over.

271
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:57,000
I am always at your service.

272
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:00,100
Renewed condolences, Malena.

273
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:11,000
What a piece of ass!

274
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,900
Son of a bitch!

275
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,100
You little runt!
Come back here!

276
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,400
- Can't you sing in Italian?
- Can't you speak German?

277
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,900
Renato, get up. It's late.

278
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,200
Monster!

279
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,400
You're a fetishist,

280
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,800
a sadomasochist,
or even worse, a pervert!

281
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,000
- What is that?
- It's just a French hat, Ma!

282
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,000
Shame on you!

283
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,900
- How pretty. Can I keep them?
- You shameless girl!

284
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,800
What are you looking at?
Get out of here!

285
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,800
Come here, you little pig!

286
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,600
- Goddam pervert!
- What did I do?

287
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:25,700
You're not permitted to sit
at the table with us, understand?

288
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,100
- Answer me!
- Okay!

289
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,200
You no longer have the right
to speak to your sisters, understand?

290
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,200
Lock me up! I'll show you!

291
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:43,000
You're not to leave this room
until further notice!

292
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:48,400
Son, at least have some soup.
It will do you good.

293
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,200
Pietro, he hasn't eaten
for three days.

294
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,800
In the Soviet Union,
they never eat. Still...

295
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,300
What is this shit?

296
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,400
The Fascists gave it to us.
At least it looks like coffee.

297
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,400
Sure, and I look
like Vittorio De Sica.

298
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,100
Everything they give us
is terrible!

299
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,200
Look at these pockets.
They're always ripping open!

300
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,200
This cheap thread
doesn't hold the stitches!

301
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,000
The thread isn't the problem!

302
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:17,600
While our son recites poetry,
his hands go to work in his pockets!

303
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:21,100
What does that mean?

304
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,000
Do you get it now?

305
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,600
Just as well! Don't fix them.
Sew the pockets closed!

306
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,300
But he'll have no pockets?

307
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,000
He'll work it out.
It will be good for his health!

308
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,700
Lights out!

309
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:42,200
"...that the weary spirit may ne'er
repose in more restful harbour..."

310
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,600
- Has he gone crazy?
- I think he's gone blind.

311
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,400
"While upon women's work
you sat intent

312
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:58,200
"content with the vague future
you held in mind

313
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:02,600
"was the scented May,
and thus you used to spend your days."

314
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,600
- This child needs air.
- Air?

315
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,000
Air.

316
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,700
Good morning, Professor.

317
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,900
This letter is for you.

318
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,500
It says "urgent".

319
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,000
You're dishonoured.

320
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,600
Your daughter Malena is sleeping
with the whole town.

321
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,900
It was an anonymous letter,
but I read it!

322
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,100
It says Malena is a whore
with everyone in town!

323
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,500
So there's hope for us too!

324
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,700
Take it back!

325
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:15,500
I'll bust your ass,
Mr Short Pants!

326
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,900
Tonight was wonderful.

327
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,000
For me too.

328
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,500
I know it's
been only ten months since.

329
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,200
But maybe I can see you again.

330
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,800
All right. You win. Tomorrow.

331
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,900
Okay, as long as
I'm not on duty.

332
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,200
- Thanks for the flowers.
- You're welcome.

333
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,700
Take care of yourself.

334
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:39,500
So see you tomorrow?

335
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,300
- Until then.
- Good night, Leone.

336
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,900
What time?

337
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,300
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, my ass!

338
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:57,700
How dare you
pester my fiancee!

339
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,100
There must be a misunderstanding.
I was invited.

340
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,000
You're a liar and a bastard!

341
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,700
Because I'm in uniform,
I cannot retaliate, sir.

342
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,200
- But you will answer to me.
- Anytime. Anywhere.

343
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:13,800
Coward, scoundrel!

344
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,500
Get up.

345
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,500
Come here! I'll tear you apart,
you coward!

346
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,500
I'll break you in two!

347
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,900
Let me go! Or I'll have
to get tough with you!

348
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,700
Here's the adulterer!

349
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,200
My wife!

350
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,300
- Officer, look! He's cheating on me!
- With a man?

351
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,400
With a traitor!

352
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,600
You said you wouldn't touch her
with a ten-foot pole!

353
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,700
It's the dentist!

354
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,400
I've been spying on you
a long time, you bastard!

355
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,300
And as for you

356
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,000
go steal husbands
from your own village, you whore!

357
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,900
We knew she had one lover,
but two?

358
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,700
But where does the dentist fit in?

359
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,200
He fits in between her legs!

360
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,600
Her father was forced
to quit the school in disgrace.

361
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,800
He never wants
to see his daughter Malena again.

362
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,100
And the dentist's wife
kicked him out of his house.

363
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:16,300
That dragon of a wife
will drag him into court!

364
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,800
What's the dentist got to do
with it, poor guy?

365
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:23,500
Malena's the whore!
She should be taken to court!

366
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,200
That Lt Cadei
seemed like such a gentleman.

367
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,700
How could he get mixed up
in this?

368
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:32,200
Everyone knows
she's a home wrecker.

369
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,600
The lieutenant was asking for it!

370
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,700
She's not from here.
She forgets where she is.

371
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,200
Will they go to court?

372
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,800
Of course, she could go to jail.
He's a married man!

373
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:48,900
The dentist needed three stitches
in his head.

374
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,900
But the dentist
swore at the soldier first.

375
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,500
That's insulting an officer.

376
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,800
We'll all end up in court!

377
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,200
While we were
watching her caboose

378
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,800
the lieutenant and the dentist
were riding the train!

379
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,800
She's either going
to the lawyer's or the notary's.

380
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:04,900
Sure, but what will she do
with two old men like them?

381
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,700
- Excuse me.
- Come in.

382
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,500
Can I help you?

383
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,500
May I speak
to Lawyer Centorbi?

384
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,500
Please have a seat.

385
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:21,500
Sir, it's the widow Scordia!

386
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:25,700
Can it be true?
Beautiful Madonna!

387
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,500
Have her come in.

388
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,500
Please sit down.

389
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,000
Charmed.

390
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,200
We now continue with the testimony
of Maddalena Bonsignore,

391
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,700
the widow Scordia,

392
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,900
called Malena.

393
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,100
She could get two years in prison.

394
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,500
Everything will be fine, trust me.

395
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:24,000
You're accused of involving
Dr Gaspare Cusimano

396
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,800
in a secret
and amorous relationship

397
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:30,300
aimed at the breaking up
of his family.

398
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,400
Do you know Dr Cusimano?

399
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,100
Yes.

400
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:40,100
Are you or have you ever been
his fiancee?

401
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,200
Absolutely not.

402
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,300
How could I be engaged
to a married man?

403
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,900
Why was Cusimano,
at that unusual hour

404
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,500
on his way to your house?

405
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,700
I don't know.

406
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,800
Had he been in your company
on previous evenings?

407
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:13,800
Yes, once.

408
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,600
Where?

409
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,400
At my house.

410
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,200
Jumped right in, the dentist did.
He looks stupid, but...

411
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,800
How long did he stay?

412
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,500
Not long.

413
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,200
What did you do?

414
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,500
He brought me some medicine
for my father.

415
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:49,600
If it was for your father,
why did he bring it to you?

416
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:50,900
I don't know.

417
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:56,200
What did you do after
he gave you the medicine?

418
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,600
He said goodbye and left.

419
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,200
Then why

420
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:06,800
has Cusimano,
a reputable professional,

421
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,600
who, five years ago,

422
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,700
had the honour of extracting
one of Il Duce's teeth

423
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:15,300
publicly declare
that he is your fiance?

424
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:18,300
He made that up.

425
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,000
I had nothing to do with it.

426
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:21,800
Your husband's crazy.

427
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:26,800
What kind of relationship
did you have with Lt Cadei?

428
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,800
I'm a widow.

429
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:34,700
My business
and that of Lt Cadei

430
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:37,200
are no concern of the law.

431
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,900
All right.

432
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,800
Did you know that,
as a result of these affairs

433
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Lt Cadei was transferred
to Albania?

434
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:48,200
One down.

435
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,500
And before his departure,
he was questioned in judicial inquiry.

436
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:52,800
Clerk.

437
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:58,300
He declared to have encountered
the widow Scordia only twice

438
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,400
in her home

439
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,500
and to have had
no amorous relationship

440
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:08,900
considering their relationship
"just a casual friendship."

441
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,400
Son of a bitch.

442
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:18,200
Lt Cadei was received
by my client

443
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,800
and she makes no secret
about having had for him

444
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:25,200
certain feelings.

445
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:29,100
But unlike the married Cusimano

446
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,600
who was, let's face it, guilty

447
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:34,000
of a pre-senile dimming
of the senses

448
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:38,700
of an intoxicating
kaleidoscope of desires...

449
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,000
What's he saying?

450
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,700
Unlike the family man Cusimano,

451
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,600
Cadei is...

452
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,000
...and was

453
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:53,700
a bachelor!

454
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:56,200
Clever, that lawyer.

455
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,700
He's a bachelor himself.

456
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:03,300
Careful investigation
of the facts tell us, therefore

457
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:06,800
that the Scordia woman
committed no other crime

458
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,500
than that of being ill-fated,

459
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,100
alone

460
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,200
and beautiful.

461
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,200
Here is her crime:

462
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,000
her beauty!

463
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,500
And from here, the envy,

464
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,400
the lies,

465
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,200
the disgrace

466
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:28,300
that have deprived her
even of a father's trust!

467
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,900
And yet, she herself
is still in silent agony,

468
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,600
in faraway East Africa.

469
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:41,900
In the beating heart
of our argument

470
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,100
is an audacious,
but nonetheless valid, thesis,

471
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,300
which asks just one question:

472
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,700
Can a young woman

473
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:56,600
after the odyssey of a widowhood
endured for the love of country

474
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:01,600
hope for protection
in the shelter of a new life?

475
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:05,500
Does she have the right
to yearn for, and to write

476
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,800
a new ending
to her own love story?

477
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,600
Your Honour,

478
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:13,900
the citizens of Castelcuto reply:

479
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,200
"Yes!"

480
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,700
Will Cusimano leave me alone now?

481
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,600
Of course.

482
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,500
He's been put into
a psychiatric clinic.

483
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:35,800
He wants to volunteer
for the Forces in East Africa.

484
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,200
He doesn't realise
we lost Africa ages ago!

485
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,900
But let's forget Cusimano

486
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,500
and the fickle Lieutenant Cadei.

487
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,100
Let's get to us!

488
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,100
I know it's not much.

489
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,100
But it's all I have.
They've cut my pension.

490
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,400
Don't you understand?

491
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:02,600
That's peanuts!

492
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,200
My fee is much more than that.

493
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,900
You'll never have enough money!

494
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:12,100
But how will I ever repay you?

495
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,900
It's very easy, my sweet.

496
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,700
- What are you saying?
- Be with me, my love!

497
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:21,000
I'm in love with you!

498
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:31,200
A woman shouldn't be alone
during these hard times.

499
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:34,600
I am a wealthy man.
You won't find better.

500
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:40,000
I'll take care of your father.
You'll never have to worry again.

501
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:58,500
I forgive her.

502
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:01,600
She did it
to pay her lawyer's fee

503
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,200
only once and never again.

504
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,700
But you didn't keep our agreement.

505
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:10,000
Now we're even.

506
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:18,300
...in the South, the Allied bombings
have forced thousands to flee.

507
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:25,100
Refugees are pouring into
the countryside and the port towns.

508
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,400
Citizens of these regions
have been alerted

509
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:31,400
to possible severe food shortages
and outbreaks of disease.

510
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:00,900
Signora Malena,
a more capable person than me

511
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:04,800
wrote that the only true love
is unrequited love.

512
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:06,900
Now I understand why.

513
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
It's been so long since you
last came out of your house.

514
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:13,900
But the longer we are apart,
the stronger my love becomes.

515
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:18,300
Τhey say you're about to marry
Centorbi, the lawyer.

516
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,300
I know how badly
they treat you here

517
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,000
how the women in the market
won't sell you any good food

518
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:26,400
and no man would hire you
for fear of his wife.

519
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:29,900
But how will you manage to live
with a fat, old man,

520
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:34,400
so ugly that no girl
ever wanted him?

521
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:39,500
Τhey say he never washes
and stinks like a goat.

522
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,400
How will your smooth, white skin,

523
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,800
bear rubbing against
the sweat of an old man,

524
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:48,700
who never does anything
without his mother's consent?

525
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:16,300
Is it true you're getting married?

526
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,700
What are you writing?

527
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,100
Give me that! Let me see!

528
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:27,600
Get out!

529
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,200
Stand up straight.

530
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,400
A little longer, Don Placido.

531
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:56,400
More room in the waist,
for when he gets bigger.

532
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,000
Will they be ready tomorrow?

533
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:01,600
The war has ruined my business,
but it still takes time.

534
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,200
...as Allied bombings continue.

535
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,200
Wait for me.

536
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:18,900
Lord, help me with my mother,
I beg you.

537
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:26,900
Moron!

538
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,200
Idiot!

539
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:32,000
You can't treat me like a child.
I'm a grown man!

540
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,300
Get this straight!

541
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,900
Your father's good name will never
belong to that disgusting whore!

542
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:43,200
Never! Never!

543
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,600
The lawyer was left high and dry!

544
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:13,600
His mother still bathes him
every Saturday!

545
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:16,300
Malena always has someone
throwing a wrench in the works!

546
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:20,500
It won't be hard finding someone
to replace the lawyer!

547
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,200
Come on, sit down.

548
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:26,100
The next in line
already has a plan.

549
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:29,300
Yeah, his plan is in his pants.

550
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:32,400
- A cut and shave.
- Right away, sir.

551
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,300
Good morning, Antonio.

552
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:36,000
I brought some sugar and flour.

553
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,600
- What about the bread?
- The best.

554
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
- I can't pay right now.
- That's no problem.

555
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,600
I'm sure we can find a way
to make you some money.

556
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,800
Hurry, there's someone else
over here!

557
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,000
Stand back!

558
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,600
It's Professor Bonsignore.

559
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:25,000
Malena's father.

560
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,100
I'm here for you.

561
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,900
Condolences, Signora Scordia.

562
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:05,100
Condolences.

563
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,800
Step aside, kid.

564
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:15,600
Signora, what can we do?
We're in the Lord's hands.

565
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:23,900
Don't forget my offer.

566
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,500
You don't have to go hungry.

567
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:32,900
Attention, loyal citizens!
This is "a call to arms".

568
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,500
We must maintain our faith
and hope in the Republic

569
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:41,300
in the face
of imperialistic aggression!

570
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,200
Despite recent setbacks
on the front

571
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:49,100
and escalating hardships at home

572
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,700
remember that nothing can dim

573
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:57,100
our fervour
for our glorious homeland!

574
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:49,500
Can you believe it?

575
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,200
Just a few years ago,
Il Duce promised

576
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:53,900
that the Nazis
would never occupy Sicily.

577
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:56,100
Now he's sold us down the river!

578
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:00,100
Look!
The Germans are everywhere!

579
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,800
- Look who's here.
- She's a redhead now.

580
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:30,200
Look how she's put together.

581
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:32,700
I'd like to cut off that hair.

582
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,600
I'd skin her alive!

583
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,100
How disgusting!

584
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:41,800
- Who is it?
- It's me.

585
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:44,700
- Me who?
- Salvatore. Antonio sent me.

586
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:47,200
I brought you some more food.

587
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,400
Come in.

588
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:06,000
- Your hair looks terrific.
- Do you like it?

589
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:09,400
- Yes, it makes you look younger.
- Thank you.

590
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,600
I can come every Thursday!

591
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:23,200
As long as you bring the food.

592
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:40,400
Now she's even screwing
the Germans.

593
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:44,100
- Who's that?
- Malena Scordia, the slut.

594
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:48,700
She's teamed up
with that other whore, Gina.

595
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:50,700
But with the Germans?

596
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:53,600
Seems there are gymnastics
at the Moderno Hotel.

597
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:57,600
The two whores run
from room to room

598
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:01,500
servicing a dozen officers
at a time.

599
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:03,600
Holy shit!

600
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:38,100
My good woman, this child
is possessed by the devil!

601
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,500
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

602
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:58,400
That's enough!

603
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:01,700
It looks like you're posing for
Michelangelo's Pieta of the poor!

604
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:08,300
Evil eye on blood is fed.
Hold on fast till death is past.

605
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:12,500
Exorcise the devil from this child.

606
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,700
Goat red, on wood fed,
hold on fast.

607
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:18,600
Head and tail,
evil eye release this child.

608
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,900
Cast the devil into the wild.

609
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,700
Shameful! Disgraceful!

610
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:26,600
They cured my uncle this way

611
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,600
and he had cholera!

612
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:31,400
Your son's not sick!
He's becoming a man!

613
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:35,200
With a dick this big,
he needs to fuck!

614
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:53,700
Renato, wait here for me.

615
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,900
Come here. Come on.
Close the door.

616
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,100
- My father?
- He's coming.

617
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:09,300
Ladies!

618
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,300
Choose the one you like.

619
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,400
Ladies!

620
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,300
What do we have here?

621
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,600
Fresh young meat.

622
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:37,800
Lupetta, up to the room.

623
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:42,300
Treat him right.

624
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,800
- What's your name?
- Amoroso Renato.

625
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,900
What a romantic name!

626
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,800
Tonight we either die in a bombing
or end up in jail.

627
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:05,500
Go ahead.

628
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:15,700
- Is it your first time?
- No.

629
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,400
I've imagined it many times.

630
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:23,700
Let's go give that shameless whore
what she deserves.

631
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:31,700
Stay back.
This is between the women.

632
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:44,000
Now you'll see what happens
when you steal our men

633
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:46,000
and sleep with the filthy Germans.

634
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,800
It's the end
of spreading your legs, whore!

635
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:53,000
Now let's see
what men make of you!

636
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:57,300
This will teach you some respect!

637
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,200
The wicked come to a wicked end.

638
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:19,500
The madame is served.

639
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:30,300
Get lost!

640
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,700
Disappear!

641
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:29,700
I know that face.
Who is it?

642
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:34,800
Nino Scordia, Malena's husband.

643
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:38,500
Malena, the one who did it
with the Germans.

644
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:48,700
Poor guy.
He was better off dead.

645
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:56,400
Isn't that Malena's husband?

646
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:28,300
Hey, Giovanni,
there's a strange guy.

647
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:37,900
Do you know Malena Scordia?

648
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,800
Who's she?

649
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,200
Who are you?
This is my family's house!

650
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:44,300
We don't know anything.

651
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:47,300
When we came,
no one was living here.

652
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:49,300
No one?

653
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:06,900
Poor guy.
No one will tell him the truth.

654
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:10,900
What would you say,
"I hear your wife is a prostitute"?

655
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:14,700
I hear she's still
a great piece of ass.

656
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:18,300
I lost an arm. I wasn't dead!

657
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:22,000
Then I was taken prisoner in India
and I contracted malaria.

658
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:23,700
Tell him.

659
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,800
Me "boy-bar."

660
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,400
I have to get the coffee cups.

661
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,700
My family has lived in this town
for generations.

662
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,600
Now no one will talk to me.

663
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:43,300
My house is a refugee camp,
and my wife has disappeared.

664
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,900
No one in town knows where she is.

665
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:58,700
Help me find her.
I want to bring her home.

666
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:25,900
Excuse me. Don't you remember me?
I'm Nino Scordia.

667
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:28,500
You mistake me for someone else.

668
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:29,900
Could I have a light?

669
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,000
You were the Fascist secretary,
and you were his deputy.

670
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:34,200
You can help me.

671
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,200
Do you know what happened
to my wife?

672
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:39,100
Didn't she join
the Communist Party?

673
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:41,700
She was photographed

674
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:44,400
with her arms
around the Commie leader.

675
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:48,900
You're a family of heroes!

676
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,100
You're right.

677
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:57,500
Those who fought the war
for you bastards aren't heroes.

678
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:02,300
Go take a walk through
the brothels of Sicily.

679
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:06,800
You may find your wife there!

680
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:09,800
Wait a minute. Come back!

681
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:18,500
Dear Signor Scordia,

682
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:22,600
forgive me if I don't have the courage
to speak man to man.

683
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,500
These last months have
taught me much about courage,

684
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:28,200
even if I have found little myself.

685
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:32,400
I'm the only one who knows
the truth about your wife.

686
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:35,600
Around here, they only say
bad things about her.

687
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:36,800
But believe me,

688
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:39,700
your wife Malena
was faithful to you.

689
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:43,900
You are the only man she loved.
This is the honest truth.

690
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,400
It is true,
a lot of things happened,

691
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:50,200
but back then,
you had been dead a long time.

692
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:53,400
Τhe last time I saw her,
she was on a train for Messina.

693
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:55,100
Best of luck.

694
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:59,400
I should sign "a friend",
like all anonymous letters,

695
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:02,000
but my name is Renato.

696
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:42,700
Good morning, Judge.

697
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:47,200
All is well, thank God.

698
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:50,800
Eat up, my sweet pea.

699
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:04,800
Sons of bitches!

700
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:07,300
Look who's here!

701
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:09,400
Giorgio, look who's here!

702
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,900
Why are you all looking
at that woman?

703
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:15,100
It's nothing.

704
01:24:43,300 --> 01:24:46,600
I saw them in the square.
They were walking arm in arm.

705
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:48,700
Quiet. She's here!

706
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:53,400
It took a lot of courage
to come back.

707
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:55,400
Look who's here.

708
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:00,900
I heard it,
but I didn't believe it.

709
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:05,100
What have they got to look at?
They should leave her in peace.

710
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:08,300
She's got some wrinkles
around her eyes.

711
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:09,700
She's put on weight too.

712
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:14,500
But she's still beautiful.

713
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:17,200
Good morning, Mrs Scordia.

714
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:33,700
Good morning.

715
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:41,100
Want some nice tomatoes?
They cost less over there.

716
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:42,700
Thank you.

717
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,800
Nice things here!

718
01:25:47,900 --> 01:25:50,100
Like it, Signora Malena?

719
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:53,000
- Try it on.
- No, that's okay.

720
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:56,000
- It's no problem.
- Another time.

721
01:25:56,100 --> 01:25:57,900
Give me your bag.

722
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
We'll discuss it later.

723
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:08,600
Good morning, Signora Malena.

724
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:05,100
It's okay. I'll get it.

725
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:10,800
Thank you.

726
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:14,800
Thank you for your help.

727
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:23,700
Good luck, Signora Malena.

728
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:53,600
I pedalled as fast as I could,

729
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:55,300
as if I were escaping

730
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:59,300
from longing, from innocence,
from her.

731
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:02,500
Time has passed,
and I have loved many women.

732
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:05,800
And as they've held me close,

733
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:09,700
and asked if I will remember them

734
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:14,100
I've said,
"Yes, I will remember you."

735
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:18,900
But the only one
I've never forgotten

736
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,700
is the one who never asked...

737
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,100
Malena.
